                        These pages and sub-pages are backups of old website I’ve created consolidated into one place to
                        make it easier to access, without the need to jump between multiple places.

                        The <a href="./backups/japanese/page.html">Japanese URI</a> backup pages are backup of my
                        Japanese assignments when I was a student at the
                        University of Rhode Island (from 2019-2021). So video clips of my Japanese speaking assignments,
                        writing assignments, and etc. More details about each sub-page can be found in the link above.

                        The <a href="./backups/chariho/page.html">Chariho Summer</a> backup pages are a backup of my
                        Summer homework when I was a high school
                        student at Chariho High School back in 2015 (so in 10th grade). It contains content about what I
                        did over the summer of 2015 and how it relates to my school’s portfolio assignment requirements.
                        The portfolio was a requirement set by the school the replaced normal senior projects. Students
                        had to acquire a number of items that fit certain categories to graduate, and in a lot of them
                        you can only get in certain classes. The portfolio is in 10 categories and each of the my
                        Chariho website’s page detail each one (in regard to my activities):
