                    <p>
                        This page is essentially my digital portfolio of what I did over the Summer of 2015
                        before the
                        Chariho School year of 2015-2016. This site will go over what 10 activity categories of
                        the
                        Portfolio I did over the summer.

                            <h3>Who am I and what are my Interests?</h3>
                            <p>
                                My name is Austin Lanphear and I am an 11th Grade Student at Chariho High School who has
                                an
                                Interest in Technology and Science. My leisurely activities consist of playing video
                                games
                                (alone or with friends), watching online videos such as YouTube, learning about science
                                and game
                                development, and going outside to relax or work on a project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Science has always been a big factor in my life because it reveals how our universe
                                works and
                                that to me has always been intriguing and inspiring. Computers have always been apart of
                                my life
                                ever since I was young, and I believe it helped me gain a technological advantage over
                                my peers
                                because I used it from a very young age and not many people at the time had access to
                                them, it
                                also gave me a new hobby. Anime was introduced to me from Cartoon Network and ever since
                                then I
                                occasionally watch a show or two for entertainment and a source of relaxation, anime is
                                one of
                                the many reasons why I have an interest in Japanese culture.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Video Games, are the defining factor on who I am. They have always been my main source
                                of
                                entertainment and why I have an interest in game design. Video Games gave me an interest
                                in
                                orchestral music, Japanese culture (Nintendo), and more subjects. Outdoors has always
                                been
                                important to be, it mixes with science and my love for astronomy, it gives me relaxation
                                and a
                                goal to reach when working on projects outside such as a campsite.

                                That wraps a mini autobiography of myself, I hope it gives you a general insight on why
                                I made
                                the decisions I did over the summer for each expectation.
