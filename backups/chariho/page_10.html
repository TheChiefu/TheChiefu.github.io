                                <p>
                                    This summer has been an interesting ride, I saw a bunch of movies that I haven’t
                                    seen
                                    before. All of which were created by the famous animator <b>Hayao Miyazaki</b>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It all started because I was watching YouTube as I normally do and kept seeing a
                                    video
                                    appear in the “Recommended for You” section. I originally gave it no thought and
                                    made
                                    fun of the video because of the funny thumbnail image. However I gave in and finally
                                    watched the trailer despite making fun of it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From there I wanted to know who made it and found out that movies trailers that I’d
                                    seen
                                    such as “Ponyo” in 2009 were created by the same studio. They were called “Studio
                                    Ghibli” and then got interested in their entire Filmography.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Apparently I’d also been a fan of their content without realizing it as well, since
                                    I’d
                                    been listening to the soundtrack from the movie “Princess Mononoke”, for a while and
                                    it
                                    was from the same studio. Ever since then I’ve watched 14 movies from their studio
                                    and
                                    got into all the music.

                                    These movies inspired me to learn Japanese and have made me have the strange effect
                                    of bettering my understanding of spoken Japanese since I’d be listening to the
                                    language for over an hour (sometimes two). I could pronounce and understand Japanese
                                    better, as well as used this time to reinforce the pronunciation and sounding of the
                                    language.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The movies also introduced me to a new Musical artist by the name <b>Joe
                                        Hisaishi</b> an
                                    orchestral conductor and music creator, who creates music for <b>Studio Ghibli</b>.
                                    Since I
                                    am an avid fan of orchestra I adored all the musical pieces in the movies and listen
                                    to his music all the time now.

                    <h3>Experience: Planning for the Future</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the summer rolls around I usually have 2 and half months free to do whatever I
                        can think of. This has it’s downsides due to the fact that most (if not all) of my
                        friends work for most (or entirety) of the summer, so I spend most of my time
                        planning. Odd for a teenager but since I know I only have 2 years of High-school
                        left I better know what I’m doing, to head for the goal I want. When planning I look
                        for what profession I want to enter and at what position. So I generally look at
                        Colleges and places to move to if (or when) I move abroad. My life goal is to move
                        to Japan and become a Game Developer in the position of a Level Designer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I’ve learned from Planning is almost exactly what I want to do with my life (of
                        course over time my mind can change), but my set goal is to save money now for
                        college at URI and hopefully take 4 years for my Bachelors degree in Game Design and
                        move to Japan; or even better move abroad to Japan and study there for game design.
                        My dream has always been to live in either Tokyo「東京都」, Osaka 「大阪市」, or even (which
                        would make happier) the rural areas such as the countryside or mountains.
                    </p>
