                            <h3>Activity: Creating a Home in a Video Game World</h3>
                            <p>
                                I know this task may seem trivial and small, but the task at hand took hours of time and
                                thinking to create. In the virtual game, <b>Minecraft</b> my family (brother, cousin, brother’s
                                girlfriend, cousin’s boyfriend, and I) decided to create a world and live within it.
                                Fighting off monsters and creating a place of living to keep safe. I usually handled the
                                housing but creating the house took time. I had to mine out the blocks and create rooms
                                for everyone, organize items so that we didn’t spend hours looking for them, a tram way
                                to different locations, and a working area to create tools and armor. This was a
                                collaboration between everyone within the time frame of 2 days, in which we created a
                                house within the mountains to comfortably live in. We needed to manage a farm for our
                                food source, create a mine for resources, rooms for sleeping, and work station to create
                                tools. To those who haven’t played this game, it might seems like a small task, but it
                                takes time and effort to create such a world that the players (being my family) can
                                become attached to. Sometimes people even like to take a walk through it just because of
                                the effort put into it making the work feel like a pay off.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To explain the process of building into simple terms it’s: mine blocks, smelt blocks in
                                a furnace (with coal or wood), craft smelted blocks into new blocks, and place blocks.
                                But before building you need to craft tools to remove the area you want to build on and
                                get the resources. So it’s more than just pick up a block and place away, the game makes
                                you find and put work into the process so that you have a feeling of accomplishment.
