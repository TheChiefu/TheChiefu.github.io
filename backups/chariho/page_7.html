                            <p>
                                Although this will be explained more in <a href="page_11.html">Respect for Others</a> this was an experience that
                                can help me interact with others in a more business like manner and help me develop as a
                                working individual.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Experience: Started working on Small Game</h3>
                            <p>
                                This experience was by far the most entertaining and fun work I’d done in the summer.
                                Since I didn’t have a full-time summer job I worked on a small game as a hobby. Although
                                for fun it’s also useful for the profession I’m going for since I want to work as a
                                Level Designer, 3D Modeler, or FX-Artist and this helped me know which ones I enjoyed
                                the most and allow me to focus on one field to study up on. The game isn’t finished, but
                                going from a game concept (such as a drawing, see the <a href="page_5.html">Culture and The Arts</a> page) to a
                                full 3D environment was a stunning experience that I never had ever thought I would be
                                able to create myself.
