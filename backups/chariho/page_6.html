                                <h3>Experience: Learning the Basics of a new Language [Japanese – 日本語]</h3>
                                <p>
                                    While almost all the activities I’ve done over the Summer have been Self-Directed
                                    learning, the most interesting and meaningful experience has been the start of a new
                                    language learning process. I’ve always wanted to learn Japanese ever since I was a
                                    middle school student but, I didn’t have a good way to start learning. I jumped
                                    straight into a chart of 46 Japanese <a
                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana" target="_blank">Hiragana ⎘</a>
                                    「ひらがな」and had a hard time learning the
                                    basic 5 characters「あ、い、う、え、お」, but was easily discouraged and gave up. But I tried
                                    again last summer and made tremendous progress because I found a new site that made
                                    me learn it extremely easier. It might have just been because I aged more and found
                                    learning to be easier now than before or that before I just wanted to learn it in a
                                    day and now I know the process behind it; but either way I still made progress.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ever since last summer I learn the basic 46 <b>Hiragana</b> 「ひらがな」characters in
                                    Japanese.
                                    And this summer learned around 30 Japanese words and part of the second character
                                    set <b>Katakana</b> 「カタカナ」. The experience has been fun because it is something I’ve
                                    wanted
                                    to learn for so long. It also makes me want to live abroad more now than ever, now
                                    that I know some <i>(I know I can’t live off of what I know now but it make me
                                        inspired
                                        to learn more)</i>. I hope to start the final character set in Japanese,
                                    <b>Kanji</b> 「漢字」 a
                                    set based off of Chinese characters (being around 2000 characters for literacy). So
                                    in addition to the 60+ Japanese characters I know, I hope to learn them as well
                                    (maybe through VHS schooling because I want to live Abroad intensely and very much
                                    pay for a Japanese learning class).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But the Experience of Learning Japanese Self-Directed has been a blast and I hope to
                                    continue learning it during the school year. The helpful website that made me learn
                                    Japanese tremendously quick was <a href="https://www.memrise.com/"
