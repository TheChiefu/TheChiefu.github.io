                            <p>
                                It may seem like a small task at first when you think back yards, but since her yard is
                                so big to the point in which it used to have about a 50sq ft. shed with around 2 stories
                                high that was knocked down; it really took a while to clean. The shed had years worth of
                                burning wood and debris that it was a chore to clean up. The back yard is still not
                                fully cleaned due to the fact the shed was so extreme in size that my family and I are
                                still going piece by piece to clean it up. But this summer was by far the most progress
                                because I was outside helping for around a week or two burning day and night giant
                                pieces of wood to clean the area up. Not only was there a tremendous shed in the
                                backyard, but the previous owners of the house used to throw broken glass out, so
                                scattered throughout the yard are tiny and large pieces of glass usually hidden beneath
                                3 inches of dirt. So while everyone cleans up around the yard like the shed, I usually
                                build camping sites and rake up the leaves in the forest and find the glass. This year
                                I’ve had to find at least 4 full windows total of glass and I helped dispose of it. It
                                was a chore, but since I like cleaning up camp areas it kind of fun because it gives me
                                something to work on while outside and while I’m making a fort.
