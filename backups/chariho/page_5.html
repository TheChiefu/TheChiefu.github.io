                                <p>
                                    Making a game has always been a dream of mine, creating a game concept is the first
                                    stepping stone to making that dream become true. So this summer I created game
                                    concepts such designing dungeons and enemies that a player could face off against.
                                    It helped me start the dream of becoming a game designer and was a fun creative
                                    process. Here is an example of a dungeon concept of a fire temple, with enemy
                                    locations, door ways, keys, etc.

                                <p>
                                    Another experience that I had over the summer was attending a trip to Six flag with
                                    my two cousins and my uncle. We went for the entire day, visiting the water park and
                                    the main park. I only did the water park because by the time we got out of the water
                                    park by the evening I was already burnt out. I got to try water slides I’ve never
                                    tried before, like <b><i>The Funnel</i></b> which is a giant funnel that 4 people
                                    spin around until they ride to the bottom of the tunnel. It was a fun new experience
                                    and the
                                    sights were amazing.
