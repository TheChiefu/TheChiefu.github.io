                            <h3>Experience: Helped my father Clean Pools and Help People Out</h3>
                            <p>
                                Even though I didn’t have a full-time summer job (due to not actively looking for one) I
                                worked some days with my Father on pools, helping him out and helping others out with
                                their problems. I didn’t ask for payment but the $20 when I went was enough; it gave me
                                time to work and talk with my father on a basis I usually don’t do that often, and it
                                gave me the opportunity to work in a new environment that I hadn’t experienced before. I
                                got to see all types of people and see how a work environment really is. One pool we
                                helped clean was my grandmother’s pool (the house I stayed at for the summer) and it
                                made everyone happy because it is the only family pool. So my cousins and I got to swim
                                in the pool on Sundays and since some of my cousins were in 2nd grade they stayed in the
                                pool all day long, until we forced them out. An activity most people including myself
                                would usually do when swimming in the pool.
