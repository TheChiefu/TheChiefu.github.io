                        <p>
                            <b>Happy New Year for those who use the Gregorian Calendar!</b> I just wanted to post this
                            update to share how progress has been going on Taurus and how everything in my life is going
                            relating to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ​The question still remains though, “How’s Taurus been? What’s the progress”; which I’d
                            respond “Good question! Let me show you!”. Away from the hypotheticals the game has been
                            going great, it’s still in ​setup​ phase as I call it since the structure of the game is
                            still in progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So since after summer ended, I got a job working as a Bus Monitor & some nights after work
                            I’d go to my college classes. This for the most part has left me drained hence why no
                            posting or updates on Taurus. for months.. well that’s because I wasn’t working on it; at
                            all. Although I want to work on the game most days I’m just not motivated enough to work on
                            it. However don’t fret, I go through these phases where I go from intensely working on my
                            projects for a month straight, everyday and every hour I’m awake to doing absolutely nothing
                            for a month or two. Luckily since I took my “break” in September the down time has given me
                            new ideas for game-modes, how to structure a story in the game, and other new elements. So I
                            thought, “Hey, it’s the beginning of a new year! Why don’t I try to improve Taurus, and get
                            over the hurdle of burning myself out”. Burning myself out by spending too much of my time
                            on a project is really my Achilles-Heel and I’m making an effort to just get over it.
                        </p>

                        <p>​
                            So not to end on a incompetent ramble here are some ideas I have for Taurus in the future:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>

                                <li><b>Team Deathmatch:</b> (5v5, 4v4, 3v3) Eliminate as many enemy players until score

                                <li><b>Wing-man:</b> 2-Man Team, get as many kills as possible until time runs out.

                                <li><b>Juggernaut:</b> One player gets boss-like ship while others have to defeat boss
                                    before timer runs out. The boss player has to eliminate all enemy player lives.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>Story:</b></li>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Also since I’m a big fan of Halo’s Community aspects, I want to implement in Custom player
                            game-modes since it theoretically shouldn’t be that bad to implement. Just make public
                            player traits to edit, and save them to a file. But only time will tell…
