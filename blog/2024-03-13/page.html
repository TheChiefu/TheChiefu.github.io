                        <p>
                            It’s halfway though March and I haven’t posted in a while so I decided to make an update. If
                            I had made this post only a week or two ago I’d be writing on a more sour note, but luckily
                            things have turned around for me as of late.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To continue where I had left off in the last post (in regards to making a decision on
                            studying in Japan or staying in the US to work), I decided to stay in the United States for
                            the time being. The reason being the ability to save and travel. Both coincide with one
                            another, but I’ll start with travel.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I don’t think I’ve mentioned it in my other posts, but I have the life goal of visiting
                            every continent at least once in my life. Being on the east coast <b>and</b> living with
                            family
                            brings a unique opportunity in my life I wouldn’t have before. In Arizona I had to pay rent
                            and a plethora of expenses on just living, now that I’m back with family I can save money
                            and go on a few expensive trips that I’d be unable to do otherwise. The last places I have
                            yet to visit are: Africa, Australia, and Antarctica.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Africa I want to go to Egypt, Australia I want to go to Sydney, and well Antarctica is
                            just Antarctica. Well Egypt shouldn’t be a huge time or money sink, it’s about the same
                            distance away Europe was so that’s not a huge issue. Australia is super far away but
                            surprisingly not as expensive and I’d thought, but I might put it off until I move to Japan
                            since their longitudes are the same making travel time shorter. As for Antarctica, well it’s
                            actually in the same time-zone as the east coast US (where I want to go) and cruises are
                            usually when I take time off anyways. The real problem with Antarctica is the huge price and
                            normally that would put me off; however now that I can save more it’s become a real
                            plausibility. Especially now that a friend of mine had voiced an interest in going and we
                            can split the cost between us (a ticket for one person comes out to being only a bit less
                            than two people; so it makes sense to go with two people splitting instead of solo).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As crazy as it sounds the travel plans of Egypt and Antarctica might be apart of my
                            itinerary this year. Also, another friend of mine wants to drive up to Canada this summer so
                            I might also visit the land of the maple trees as well! If I go on any trips I’ll make sure
                            to take some good pictures and panoramas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Based on the tone of the post I likely implied I can fund these adventures and that would be
                            correct. Just a week ago I received a offer letter from my bother’s previous employer in
                            Rhode Island. I was surprised since this opportunity kind of came out of nowhere. For a
                            while I was going through a rough period of no callbacks or responses from a bunch of
                            companies and thought nothing would show up for a while. Add on to the fact that in the US a
                            lot of software developers are having a hard time finding jobs, even with 10+ years of
                            experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason I say it was out of nowhere was because despite getting recruiters reaching out
                            to me late 2023, I mostly got silence ever since January of this year and was getting
                            rejection after rejection. So when I got a call from a recruiter asking about a position at
                            the company my bother used to work at I was taken back. Oddly too was that she thought my
                            resume for working at GM listed that I had C++ experience and was the reason she reached
                            out, since the position listed was for C++.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At first she was a little hesitant on moving me forwards but I requested to give it a shot
                            anyways and they continued. I had a video meeting with the company hiring manager to do a
                            normal non-technical interview, it went well and then I moved on to do a coding challenge.
                            Thankfully the manager said that despite the challenge normally being done in python I could
                            do it in Java (the one I was familiar with at GM). It was scheduled for 2 hours and I shared
                            my screen while I solved the problem, it was a bit tricky and I honestly think I
                            over-engineered it. Apparently it was good enough and I moved on to an onsite technical
                            interview.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is where I thought I bombed. I came in and now there were 3 people, the previous
                            manager and two new ones. At first it was going normally, asking about my work history, what
                            languages I worked in etc. Then it came to some technical questions, I had a whiteboard
                            behind me and I was going through my thought process out loud. It went well at first but
                            even some simple algorithm questions stumped me and I had a lot of “I don’t know” responses
                            to the questions. As time went on and the interview ended, I shook their hands and we went
                            our ways.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Weeks passed and I heard nothing, the first few days I thought I did “okay” but had a gut
                            feeling the little knowledge I had in C++ or algorithms really shot me in the foot. Randomly
                            one day the hiring manager emails me to setup a meeting. He tells me that I didn’t get the
                            C++ position but wanted to wait telling me since he wanted to ask if there were other
                            positions available I could look into. He found one for a Python developer that mostly deals
                            with APIs and Requirements Management. Despite me not knowing much about it I said yes and
                            he went on to send me over to another manager for another interview process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To be honest I wasn’t too confident in my ability to do well in this interview, but any
                            opportunity is an opportunity so I took it. I then meet up with the new manager a few weeks
                            later in a video call and we hit it off really well, it was a non-technical and usually I do
                            really good with those. I then meet on-site a week or so later and again hit it off again
                            with another interview. Despite the meetings going well I had a gut feeling that again I’d
                            get the notification that I’d been rejected, but in spite of my pessimism I was wrong. I got
                            the letter and was given follow up emails about the on-boarding process; which leaves me
                            today. I start on the 26th of March and am eagerly waiting it. Since it looks like this time
                            I’ll be doing more involved coding work, unlike at GM.

                        <p>
                            All while this job hunt was going on I was finishing up the family archive. I still wanted
                            to build a website up from scratch and use Amazon AWS to get it all setup, but my main
                            concern over time was cost and complexity. While I was thinking how to set that up I bought
                            a Synology NAS in February to have a central place for the files to live, instead of on a
                            single USB hard-drive. The nice thing about the NAS is that it is a network device so
                            anything on the home internet can access it and I can put it in RAID so that if a single
                            drive fails I can replicate data from the other one.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My main concern with the archive was data loss since if I had anything on one device and it
                            fails, all the months of work I did would be gone, so suffice to say I was a bit paranoid of
                            losing it. I know the best practice for data preservation is the 3-2-1 backup, or 3 copies
                            of data, 2 copies on two different mediums, and one copy off-site. So what I did was have
                            one copy on the NAS (again with parity data), another copy on multiple 25GB HTL Blu-Ray
                            discs all put in a fireproof safe, and currently there is no off-site. So not quite there
                            yet but pretty close, when I move I’ll have a copy with me personally and that’ll satisfy
                            the rule.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Continuing though, as I was toying around I noticed that I could host a website on it and
                            direct users to the photo app. So instead of spending all this time learning PHP and the 3-4
                            different services on AWS to host the site, I could just let the NAS host a static HTML page
                            I made and direct to the Synology Photo app. Additionally I could setup user accounts so
                            that the public would not have any access to the files. So now I also didn’t have to learn
                            SQL and a bunch of security practices and headaches that would entail, a win-win-win
                            situation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also setup a VPN service so that I could access the NAS externally, since I didn’t want to
                            port forward the DSM page publicly. My goal with the family archive project was for ease of
                            use for non-technical people but still high security. Although Google Drive worked in the
                            past, I had to one, pay a yearly cost to host the files, two could send links to people but
                            they would be unlisted so technically “public”, and three I couldn’t host all my files
                            without taking an absurd amount of time to upload and organize it all. All in all a huge
                            pain to work with. The NAS pretty much just worked out of the box and all I had to do was
                            open a few select ports.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s leaves me to today, where I’ve expanded the Family Archive to now include not just
                            scanned photos from photo albums and a few select photos from my travels but all my personal
                            photos and videos. They include all my YouTube videos, game development projects, and
                            pictures of my friends. Not all the files will be viewable to anyone who wants to see them
                            (I don’t have permission from my friends to show them outside the group) so I have those in
                            a “private” section where only I and a select few people can view them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’m not currently done with that yet, I had to find a date for around 400-500 more files but
                            it’s a far cry from scanning, editing, and finding a date for physical photos. However, it
                            means that in about 2 weeks I’ll be completely done unifying and collecting all the family
                            and friends photos. Well not all of them, I’m sure we’ll find scattered photos or a box once
                            in a while, but the major leg-work is done. I don’t know how I didn’t go insane doing this
                            work but I’m just glad it’s over. It consumed months of time to do and now people can access
                            a quick and easy site to look at family memories.
