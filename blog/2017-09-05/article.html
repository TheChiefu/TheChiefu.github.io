                        <p>
                            So it’s been a couple days, school has started up and so far it’s been good. One thing I do
                            before I just jump back into a project such as Taurus is that I let the <i>dust​</i> settle
                            as it
                            were in terms of things changing what I do in daily life. Since essentially the summer is
                            over my days of forgetting to eat all day because I’m so engrossed in making the game are
                            over. But nevertheless I’ll still be working on the game, mostly in the morning since I have
                            school at night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ​The question still remains though, “How’s Taurus been? What’s the progress”; which I’d
                            respond “Good question! Let me show you!”. Away from the hypotheticals the game has been
                            going great, it’s still in ​setup​ phase as I call it since the structure of the game is
                            still in progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AI logic and where to have them go is still being made.</li>
                            <li>Player movement is almost to what I’d say is a finished product and shooting is what you
                                could say is a bit <i>shotty</i>.</li>
                            <li>UI is pretty much a working proto-type; it works as intended but isn’t very pretty</li>
                            <li>Levels aren’t made as of yet, those come after the Setup phase since they consist of the
                                finished prefabs.</li>
                            <li>The Story is in the writing progress, I’ve left it on the backburner for a bit since I’m
                                focusing on the gameplay aspect first, so I can have an idea of how to write the script
                                to fit the limitations of the Game/Unity engine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ​
                            ​The progress is slow at first in the setup phase but once I get all the enemies and such as
                            prefabs levels should essentially be “drag and drop” easy. But not that​ easy. The concept
                            is down and the development is going strong. I’ve started to document all of the changes to
                            see what has been improved over time. All the game builds since the first test are still
                            saved and once the game releases will be put-up online for downloads if you want to see the
                            progress since the beginning.
