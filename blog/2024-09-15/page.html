                            It’s been a while since I late updated here and a decent amount has happened, so I’ll do a
                            quick one.

                        <h2>New Job and Finishing Family Archive</h2>

                        <p>
                            I’ve been at my new job for a couple months now and I’ve got settled into my role pretty
                            well. It did take me a couple months to really feel comfortable though since I got my normal
                            nervousness, shakiness, and depressive symptoms the first 3 months at my new job. It was
                            mostly because everything was new and I felt extremely overwhelmed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I did learn though that this seems to be a common theme when making a life change for me
                            (feeling depressed & sick), since last time I felt sick and it hurt to eat was when I was
                            moving from AZ back to RI. I stopped drinking soda for a few months, I got a reverse osmosis
                            water purifier, an air-purifier, etc. All to eliminate any factors that would adversely be
                            effecting my health. I started getting in the routine of taking long walks and keeping up
                            with my Japanese to keep my mind occupied. However as I started to feel more normal my old
                            habits slowly came back. I think my heightened anxiety was making me feel like I had to do
                            something to distract myself. Luckily around May I felt more or less normal and the
                            expectations I put on myself towards my job became more realistic and less <i>impostor
                                syndrome</i>
                            -esque. I put aside some photos for the family archive, but for a while after
                            starting my job I had no energy to work on them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Around June I completely was done with the family archive and I added in some
                            VHS recordings laying around the house. In July I added some new pictures of my trip to
                            Egypt that my brother and I went to. To be honest I should of done more research on the
                            country before going. Egypt, or more specifically Cairo is the worst place
                            I’ve ever been to in any country (including the US).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Trip to Egypt</h2>

                        <p>
                            I wasn’t expecting a lot, since I don’t care if a country is pristine and
                            advanced (my Peru hotel has a huge brick missing from the shower wall). But Cairo was
                            surprisingly dilapidated and under-maintained. Again I should of done my research and I
                            normally don’t care, but what set me over on putting this place as the worst I’d ever
                            visited in the rudeness of everyone.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I arrived in Egypt tired as usual from almost 24 hours of being awake and got to the hotel
                            where my brother was waiting. I took a big nap and got some good sleep for the upcoming
                            day since we were going to the Pyramids the next day. I then woke up a bit early and watched
                            some
                            videos on my phone for a bit waiting for my brother to wake up. We got ready to go and
                            then took take a taxi ride to the Giza necropolis. Everything was going fine, we stopped and
                            took pictures of important places like the Nile and I got to look around the city for a bit.
                            However, the rudeness start as soon as we get to the first shop of the day.
                        </p>

                            At first I thought it was just a small museum, since it had lots of papyrus and the guy
                            there was telling us how the ancient Egyptians made it. Then he started to try and sell it
                            to us, it started small with little $5 papers, working all the way up until the multi
                            hundred dollar poster sized pieces. I only spent around $30 USD for a small piece to get as
                            a gift and a medium size one for myself. The store owner tried to haggle a bit but I didn’t
                            budge. It kind of ticked me off but I brushed it aside as just him specifically being rude.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My brother and I leave the shop, get back in the taxi, and ride to a different shop near the
                            Pyramids. We get there and they tell us about what kind of ways we can get around the
                            Pyramids, we can take camels, horses, etc. All for $200 per person! I thought it was too
                            much and I didn’t want to, but my brother and the salesman convinced me so I just went along
                            with it. We got on the camels and a new guide arrived for the ride. I thought he was apart
                            of the $200 we paid for the ride, but nope apparently he’s just another guy we are supposed
                            to pay some random price for. This is where I’m starting to get pissed. Regardless I just
                            continue going on, since I was there to see the Pyramids.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While we’re riding through the streets getting to the necropolis some little girl tries to
                            beg me for money. All while looking completely healthy and pristinely clean, I just
                            pretended to ignore her since I was already pissed and plainly offended I was just seen as
                            walking money and not a person. After a bit I start to get light headed due to the heat and
                            start to pass out. During this, one of the guides tries to offer me a soda. In this moment I
                            didn’t know if he was trying to be helpful or trying to sell me something so I just refuse
                            it and drank the water I already had on me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Eventually we get to one of the Pyramids and we walk down the tiny door corridor to the
                            bottom. It was cool to see the inside, but again some random guy in the Pyramid starts to
                            harass us for money and to take pictures for us. My brother and I take our pictures and
                            leave back to the tour guide. We continue into the edge of the Sahara and I take my
                            panoramic of the Giza necropolis. The guide also got a picture of my brother and I together
                            in front of them. I am glad I took the trip out to the Pyramids and got the pictures but
                            honestly it’s very sad the state modern Egypt is in and how they treat their historical
                            sites.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Throughout the necropolis plastic bottles are just tossed everywhere, trash littered in
                            random places, and a general state of disrepair. My brother and I continued our tour and by
                            the end of it they asked us for a tip for the guide. We give them a couple USD and I tried
                            to pay the $200 for the actual camel ride, however my card keeps getting declined. Luckily
                            my brother covered for me and we headed back to our taxi ride. By this point I’m pissed off
                            at everything and how everyone is treating us, I just wanted to be back at the hotel, lock
                            the door, and be by myself in peace. Unfortunately though we still had more to the trip.

                            We got back in the taxi and were brought to some new corner store, I refused to buy anything
                            and just waited until we got to the next stop. The next stop was the national museum and I
                            took a breather since no one there was harassing us for money or services, plus it had air
                            conditioning. We spent about an hour there walking around and talking, seeing the mummies,
                            artifacts and more until we hailed our taxi driver back. I was still exhausted from the day
                            and wanted to go back to the hotel but we had one more place to visit apparently.

                            We took a drive to a port near the Nile where they were trying to sell us a boat tour. My
                            brother wanted to see the Nile up close and touch it, however as he walked down the stairs
                            to the edge of the river he realized how dirty it was. It was a sickly green with plastic
                            trash covering the edge of the banks. My brother backed up and said he was fine not touching
                            the river.

                            We both went back to the taxi and randomly stopped next to some smoothie place. Our driver
                            gets out and goes to into the tiny shop. I see him walk out with two smoothies and I start
                            to roll my eyes thinking, “is he also trying to sell us something?”. Luckily he gave it to
                            us without asking for money and drives back to the hotel. In that little moment I was happy
                            since it felt like he was the only person in the entire city to show us any kindness.

                            As soon as we got back to the hotel I got in the shower, cleaned up, and flopped on the bed.
                            I was not leaving that hotel room until we we’re leaving. Luckily the trip we had was only
                            for 4 days (2 for airport, 2 for exploration), so the next day I just stayed in the hotel
                            watching videos and relaxing in the tub. I was starting to feel a bit sick a the start of
                            the day so even if I wanted to go out I wasn’t going to feel great doing so anyways. My
                            brother walked around the hotel, got some food, went to the pool, etc so at least he got
                            some value out of the trip. As for me, I couldn’t wait to get on the plane back home.

                            Before it started getting dark out we both walked to the airport terminals that we’d be
                            leaving in to get a good idea of what it was like the morning we’d be leaving. I’m so glad
                            we did that since arriving in Cairo is easy, but leaving it not. Apparently to leave Cairo
                            you need to go through 3 security checks. One before you get your boarding pass, another to
                            check your boarding pass, and another at the gate before you board the plane. Before we got
                            our tickets we could only walk around the public section of the airport, so we did that for
                            a while until I decided I was going to get some early sleep for the next day.

                            My brother and I could barely get any sleep since his flight left at 3AM the next day and
                            mine at 5AM, so we just decide to go early at 12AM and wait there for our boarding passes to
                            be available. We both get there, hug, part our ways and go on our flights back home. Nothing
                            really eventful happened at the airport since I was waiting for 5 hours with no sleep, all
                            while feeling very sick and finding bathrooms to take paper towels from to blow my nose.

                        <p>
                            The entire way back I felt dreadful, couldn’t sleep, and once I stepped foot back in RI I
                            felt so relieved. My ears wouldn’t pop from the air pressure change, I could barely hear, I
                            felt tired but couldn’t sleep, and my sinuses were inflamed. But I just took a shower and
                            slept as soon as I got back home. So overall not a very pleasant experience, but at least I
                            tried it and didn’t do it alone.
