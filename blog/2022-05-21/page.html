                            So it’s been an inside joke among my friend’s group that Reclamation was so poorly made that
                            no amount of optimizing would fix it. The problem originally was that when I made the demo
                            back in 2017 or so when I was still in high school and had pretty much zero experience in
                            coding whatsoever. I mean I knew a tiny bit of coding; I knew a tiny bit of JavaScript from
                            a class that taught us it using Khan Academy and worked on learning C# / Unity when I made
                            tiny demos of Taurus for Skills USA in 2016 but nothing extensive.

                            To get some backstory on the development of the Reclamation Demo head to this post <a
                                href="../2017-09-02/article.html">here</a>, but the gist of it is that our computer
                            technology teacher left during my last year of high school and our new one didn’t have any
                            class course; so he gave us an option to work on a project for the rest of the year. Our
                            class decided to work on a game project and I tasked myself with gathering the work of
                            everyone else and putting it into a game engine. Suffice to say I was very inexperienced
                            with Unity, C#, modeling, etc; but I had a ton of fun doing it. That being said because I
                            had no idea what I was doing everything was horribly unoptimized.

                            So what was wrong with the demo in terms of technical performance? Well for the longest time
                            I didn’t really know the issue with the game’s performance because one, I didn’t have the
                            source code anymore, and two didn’t know about how unity handled scenes. Luckily one day
                            when I was backing up my old google drives and hard drives I decided to log into my high
                            school email and found the files just sitting there. I promptly downloaded them and made a
                            back up of them on my local drive and personal drive. In early 2020 I tried to see if I
                            could re-open the project and optimize the project but it proved too intensive due to how
                            many files were unused but still in some way tied to the game. Meaning if I deleted a few
                            folders of unused textures or models a rock somewhere in the level would disappear or turn
                            purple.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I decided to put it aside, until on one very boring April weekend of 2022 I decided that I’d
                            decide to do try again. This time I really studied the folders and files to see what was
                            being used, making a list of files that were actually being used and one’s that weren’t.
                            Eventually a couple hours later I reduced the project down to a few key folders of things
                            actually being used. The problem originally was that back in high school I just imported a
                            bunch of assets from the asset store and kept them there, meaning I never used a lot of the
                            files and ended up bloating the project. One cool thing I discovered about the project
                            though is that I found some unused objects that were not in the demo build, so I got to
                            re-include them again; such as the watch tower near the snow camp. However, now that I got
                            rid of unnecessary files the next step was optimization of the game world and code.

                        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Showing differences in project organization between old/new
                                source project (Left: Old / Right: New)</i></p>

                        <p>
                            This proved to be the biggest sink of time because when I first made the project the only
                            unity experience I had was messing around with the Unity terrain editor in the old versions
                            back in 2011-2014, and coding with C# in open space environments with Taurus. So then to go
                            from those simple environments to making an “open world” demo with multiple models, weather,
                            time of day, etc was a huge leap. The biggest problem was the fact that I just cranked up
                            the details and left it. So the draw distance was maxed, trees would render at almost full
                            detail meters away from the camera, the ocean waves would be super high detail with
                            displacements/reflection, and tons of other graphically intensive options.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My first place of optimization was the water since it took up the most resources; what I
                            ended up doing was replacing the Gerstner Displace component on the Water4 model that I used
                            with a simpler but still visually appealing “Water Pro” model, as well as turning off bodies
                            of water that weren’t viewable in the camera view. This dramatically improved performance
                            since for some reason even though the camera wasn’t supposed to draw out of view objects it
                            still was. The next area of world performance was to edit the trees models. This was a
                            relatively easy fix, just edit the draw distance and adjust the level of detail in which the
                            higher poly version would be replaced with the billboard. I may have adjusted it a bit too
                            far into the performance region since in the revision some relatively close trees are
                            billboards; but I still think it looks fine. There were other adjustments to things like
                            texture sizes on the terrain, LOD adjustments, reducing particle counts in effects, etc but
                            all these adjustments pail in to how much time it took to redo the code.

                            The code, oh my god… the code. I knew I didn’t know much about programming in general at the
                            time and I was pretty much stringing together whatever I could find online but wow; was this
                            the definition of spaghetti code. There were components that pretty much depended on each
                            other down several levels, functions that didn’t even work or had no functionality
                            whatsoever, classes that managed everything about an object, and multiple large areas of
                            code in the <b>update function</b>! I took the task of rewriting almost all the code since a
                            lot of
                            it was unusable or didn’t function as intended.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My basic goal was to reduce the amount of dependency everything had on each other and break
                            down the code into smaller components, the biggest example being the camera and it’s
                            manager. Since in the original demo everything was under one master class called
                            <b>DemoOptions.cs</b> and everything from keybindings for the camera, camera locations, UI
                            elements, audio, lighting, etc were all managed there. There’s nothing inherently wrong with
                            what’s essentially the game manager but I felt as if the original class was going about it
                            the wrong way; so I split it up into several different controller classes. I also added
                            functionality to the demo that was supposed to be there in the beginning but was cut or
                            doesn’t work (but is supposed to).

                        <p>
                            I did cut a few original classes however that either I didn’t use in the demo or felt didn’t
                            serve much purpose such as: PlaceName.cs (displays place name like in Skyrim when
                            approaching new area) and ScreenCap.cs (takes screenshot and saves to file).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Reorganizing the code wasn’t just for making it easier to understand and read, but also from
                            a gameplay sense. Since because a lot of the original code was either hard coded or didn’t
                            work some features in the original demo acted strangely. Like how the time of day could only
                            be adjusted when you unchecked the checkbox when it was supposed to be the opposite, the sun
                            appearing underneath the map when at night time, the volume controls barely worked, and then
                            time of day wouldn’t even go automatically. So once I fixed the code I then went onto
                            overhauling the UI.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The UI originally was really a last minute thought so the color scheme and design choice was
                            a bit rushed. Like I mentioned before some options didn’t work and if they did they behaved
                            oddly, so when I fixed the code I could set out on fixing those standout issues and
                            overhauling the UI. Here’s a list on options that I ended up correcting or adding:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time of Day works correctly (sun turns off when below certain rotation value to avoid
                                under-map lighting), and on automatic scale over time</li>
                            <li>Volume adjusts as intended without sudden jump in volume</li>
                            <li>Weather affects are less dramatic on tree leaves (before they were too intense)</li>
                            <li>Added togglable sidebar that can be open/closed</li>
                            <li>Added free-cam mode in which player can freely look around map</li>
                            <li>Added “Quit” button that the user can click without resorting to forcefully stopping
                                program</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now the game runs very smoothly! Granted not in all areas outside of the static cameras
                            mode, since in free-cam mode I left all bodies of water on and wasn’t sure how to increase
                            performance in that regard (unfortunately). But I’ve seen a dramatic improvement compared to
                            the original version, I tested it again as of the writing of this post and saw that in the
                            old version I got 8-12 FPS in the snow area, versus 40FPS with the same hardware. So I’d say
                            overall it’s a success revitalizing and redoing an old high-school project over 5 years
                            later.

                            It’s also a testament on how awesome I think computers and software are, that I can take old
                            code from years ago and made it run on newer hardware with improvements. I know it’s only 5
                            years so granted the original still works, but seeing things like the Ocarina of Time PC
                            port or other similar types of projects make me realize how cool coding really is. I could
                            take a look at the code another 5 years from now and see what new features or optimization
                            methods I can apply.

                            Well that’s all from me, I felt like making a post about this after seeing my old archived
                            post about the original game.
