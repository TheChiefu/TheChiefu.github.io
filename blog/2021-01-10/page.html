                            So I regret saying in my last year’s post that 2020 was going to be a good year due to Covid
                            and all that. But what last year has told me is how to better at understanding myself and
                            this is what this post is mainly going to be about. A journal in a sense of my thoughts
                            throughout last year up to now.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early in 2020 everything was normal, January started and I was getting used to my 2nd
                            semester at URI. I started my Japanese 102 class, 2nd part of my Computer Sciences classes,
                            the usual math class, and I threw in a climate change class because I thought it would be a
                            nice change of pace. Up until around April everything was normal, I went to campus for
                            school and work, then came home to relax or do school work. Per usual I put personal code
                            projects on hold for the sake of my school grades and sanity. I believe at this time Taurus
                            was still in the same state as the 2020 state but I was still committed to the idea mentally
                            that this would be my first finished game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this time I wanted to pursue a study abroad opportunity in Japan since I qualified for
                            the Gilman Scholarship. I spent weeks filling out paper work, regularly seeing the school
                            faulty on how to finish the steps towards a program; and eventually locked one down. I was
                            going to go to Japan the summer of 2020 through CIEE and do a 2 month study term (I
                            believe). Then I got the good news that I revived the Gilman and CIEE scholarships and I
                            began preparations to go to Japan. Then Covid-19 hit, I had to cancel my program, school
                            went from on Campus to home, and I lost my on-campus job for income.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suffice to say I was a little disappointed that I couldn’t go to Japan for the first time in
                            my life. However, my school did offer online Japanese classes in the summer so I got some
                            hope back. Now that I look at it in hindsight, going to Japan with only 4 months of study
                            was a bad <b>bad</b> idea and in regards to my job, I was lucky enough to be eligible for
                            unemployment during this period so I could still pay of my student loans in the mean time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The transition to home wasn’t too hard but maintaining focus on school lectures and work
                            while at home proved to be challenging over time. I decided a week into April to have my
                            personal computer be the “fun machine” and my laptop be strictly for school. I also
                            physically separated them on other sides of the room so I could create a “school/home”
                            balance, which helped immensely. Up until May everything was pretty much the same: wake up,
                            “go to school”, do home work, have leisure, go to bed.

                            When summer came I still had hope that maybe things would get better in regards to going out
                            since at this point I’d been at home for 2 months and missed playing Airsoft with friends.
                            But everything was still on strict lock down and my summer classes started. The summer
                            classes were intense classes and I made the decision to take the JPN 103/104 classes at my
                            university or the “Intermediate” levels of Japanese which covered the Irodori A1 series of
                            books. This is when I kind of lost my mind for a month of two. Since 4 days out of a week we
                            had to “learn” around 300 words, take a quiz on a chapter’s vocab daily, do a weekly oral
                            examination quiz on the content learned up until that point, and do project videos once a
                            week. Rinse and repeat for 8 weeks and add up Discrete math for 4 of those weeks and I was
                            ready for a long break after summer classes ended in June.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the rest of the summer I really went to town working on Taurus, since I wanted to
                            find a path for that game. I transitioned it <b>once again</b> from a Star-fox like game to
                            a third
                            person shooter game. I looked up tons of tutorials online for dedicated servers since I
                            wanted to learn about that aspect of games. And in July had a tiny area my friend and I
                            would walk around in interact with objects with. All of this followed the tutorial provided
                            by Tom Weiland and his amazing Unity Dedicated tutorial series. I initially thought “he we
                            go again author multiplayer tutorial showing me how to make one specific setup, with one
                            specific solution”. But after manually typing the code and following his video series: C#
                            Network Tutorials for a bit I really started to understand how it worked. And for the first
                            time implemented my own features to the code. I had client character customization so that
                            other players could see and it felt really amazing to have a solution I understood fully. I
                            credit his work in the current client and server builds of the game even though he doesn’t
                            ask for it because I very much appreciate his work an guides.

                        <p>
                            Eventually I had to stop once again since school started back up again in September and it
                            was <b>still</b> online. In the Fall 2020 semester I took yet again a Japanese class: 205
                            (Pre-Advanced I), Fundamentals of Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and History
                            of Modern Japan. I try to keep my Japanese and Computer Science half and half to balance out
                            variety. However this semester proved to be very… interesting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My Japanese history and language classes went fine as usual: show up to the lectures talk
                            about the topic, do the homework, rinse and repeat. But the computer science classes were an
                            entire different beast. I went from doing coding in my computer classes to what seemed to be
                            going back to 101 stuff in the fundamentals class despite being a higher level, and my
                            software engineering class being kind of a joke.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the beginning of the engineering class our teacher had us post ideas of what software we
                            want to make on the message board. Then once all of our ideas were posted we gave him our
                            top 4 picks, a week later he assigned up to groups with similar interests. Then when we got
                            in our groups we all decided on a program we wanted to make. We all decided on a Zelda style
                            2D game made in unity. I was ecstatic since I’ve always wanted to work with unity outside of
                            my hobby projects. I knew going into the project I was the only one with experience both
                            using Unity and C#. But I offered help to anyone who didn’t know what to do; knowing that
                            everyone else’s coding expertise was on the web development side of coding (Javascript
                            mainly).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything goes all well, me and a couple people do some coding on the core game mechanics.
                            I worked in a pair to create a cool magician enemy that teleports and shorts fireballs at
                            the player’s direction; while others did level creation. I was so happy I was using Unity I
                            did a lot of coding in my free time to accelerate the game progress. Well it eventually came
                            back to bite me, since around 4 weeks in my teacher makes a post on my group’s GitHub page
                            stating “one student is doing all the work you have to split up your group evenly” and all
                            called for us to attend a meeting to figure out what to do with the situation (which to me
                            was a non-issue).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We joined the meeting and I was surprised to hear what the news was. Half the group wanted
                            to switch code bases to a Javascript based format using the p5.js library to make the game.
                            I was a little confused at first since at the time we had a working game with a player,
                            simple enemies, and a starting town. The main issue being that they had a hard time
                            understanding the C# format (understandably since they never worked with it). And also
                            believed Unity was too drag and drop, so they felt like they didn’t have a much control over
                            code. We eventually switched because I felt it’d be unfair to them that we stayed in
                            Unity/C# if I was the only one who knew that system well; and if everyone was already
                            comfortable with Javascript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Months go by and eventually we hit the end of the Fall semester and the rest of my classes
                            wrap up. At this point our group was getting fed up with the coding project and slap
                            everything together last minute and somehow get a 99%. I don’t blame anyone working on the
                            project for the horrible state we left it in. I think the assumption on the teacher’s part
                            that just because we all want to make the same project that all of our diverse background in
                            programming languages would help create a cohesive project. In that people who don’t share
                            the same programming background like: Web development / Javascript (my group) and C#/C++
                            game development (me) can create a meaningful program in 3 months time. Since one group or
                            the other has to learn another language and library before they can provide meaningful code.

                        <p>
                            Luckily I passed all my classes with everything over B’s and winter break started. I was
                            noticing at this point the cracks in my Japaneses grammar and vocab I had forgotten from the
                            fast paced summer classes and decided I would study daily to make up for lost knowledge.
                            Everything went fine, I started up WaniKani again, got a lifetime subscription to BunPro,
                            and went through my entire Irodori 2 vocabulary and kanji card decks on Anki. It was full
                            “go mode” in the winter. The entire month of December was a huge boost to my Japanese
                            comprehension and I felt like I could take on the language! Then “the wall” hit me, and it
                            hit me hard.

                            I peeked into my next semester’s textbook Tobira, which according to everyone online is the
                            gateway to truly intermediate to low-advanced Japanese material (or JLPT 3 area). I felt
                            that it should be no issue, I’m at “Pre-Advanced” Japanese according to my University how
                            hard could it be? Hard… extremely hard… Even though I studied the vocabulary terms for
                            Chapter 1 before reading the texts I couldn’t make any sense of it. In a fit of fear I asked
                            the r/LearningJapanese subreddit for help breaking down a particular sentence I had issue
                            with and I told them my interpretation and parts I didn’t understand. When they broke it
                            down I realized how much grammar and conjugation forms I didn’t know. I then quickly took a
                            JLPT 3 practice quiz on their website and also didn’t understand a thing.

                        <p>
                            I felt so defeated after this, months of studying. Non-stop from September 2019 to January
                            2021. I thought I’d at least be able to read intermediate conjugate sentences. But I really
                            couldn’t. I started to noticed that if something isn’t in really simple Japanese I have a
                            pseudo-fear response to it and ignore it. During school I’d love to sit down and try to
                            understand what natives were saying in videos. But now if I hear Japanese I just freeze and
                            less it pass right through my eyes and ears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I realized at this point it was a fools errand to think that “I’m almost at Advanced
                            Japanese in school”. Which I somehow automatically assumed meant that I could somehow
                            understand Japanese without issue. That in combination with the Covid-19 pandemic still
                            being around even now, making me realize my dream since high-school to move to Japan after
                            college is still that; a dream. To add to that realization, I’ve also been doing some
                            pursuing programming jobs in Japan and it hit me hard when I found out that <b>no jobs</b>
                            are
                            available to someone without a JLPT N3 at the very least <b>and</b> without 2-3 years in the
                            related field. I realized that I have to stay here for at least 2-3 years in the US for my
                            job experience and the fact I can’t even travel to Japan really hit me hard.

                            That leaves me where I am today. I’m almost over the depressing reality of my dreams not
                            being as readily available as they once seemed, but its not all bad. I put time into
                            developing a very simple open source game during the winter to show employers I at least
                            have some programming experience and its almost finished. Like actually finished, where I
                            can open the game play it, save data, and etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also realized that the 2-3 years I’ll be in the US leaves me open to spend more time
                            refining and going at my Japanese skills. Like my seemingly squandered study trip to Japan
                            in summer of 2020, Covid-19 again might be inadvertently saving me from myself and my
                            idealized interpretation of what I want versus what’s good for me.

                            By this point in time I decided that Taurus is a lost cause in the sense of a commercial
                            game. So I have officially declared it a hobby project and not worry about it being
                            professional. I still want to make it eventually and now that I have a working multiplayer
                            server plus $500 worth of professional 3D assets. Hopefully with my experience making my
                            Winter project I can use that experience towards Taurus.

                            So that wraps up this very extensive journal post. I find making these posts therapeutic and
                            a way for me to organize my thoughts. Since a lot of times having all these good/bad things
                            happen so quickly can be disorienting. Life has its ups and downs and I’m sure I’ll remember
                            2020 for a <b>long</b> time.
