                        <p>
                            This is just a quick post to show that, “Hey! I’m still here!”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to just state that I have been working on Taurus a bit here & there but since
                            school is starting up again in a couple days its been hard focusing on the game. This
                            semester I have 6 all online courses I’ve been trying manage on-top of work so steady
                            consistent progress is tough. I’ll try to post as much as possible but there are some days
                            I’m a work-a-holic on this game and others completely drained, but you know everyone is
                            human and there are ups and downs in our work ethic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What I’ve noticed is that when I have time off of school and work such as Winter-break and
                            Summer is when I really get inspired to work on the game again; it also fills in the boredom
                            gap since I have too much time to myself.
                        </p>

                            Here’s a picture of an emblem editor I’ve been thinking of adding (Might as well post
                            something about the game):
