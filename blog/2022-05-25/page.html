                        <h2 id="t1">Last Semester of University</h2>

                        <p>
                            So a lot has happened from my last “life” post to now. I think the last post about my life
                            was back in January of 2021… geez. For starters I graduated from school full-stop. Not, I
                            finished high school then went to college to endure more school again; but <b>finally</b>
                            with
                            school <b>as a whole</b>. I knew it was going to be very life changing in regards to how my
                            daily
                            life would go but I never expected it to be as wild as it really has been.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before I go into how life currently is I have some back-tracking to do to get to today. The
                            last time I left off about my personal life I was entering my last semester year of
                            University and excited to finally be finishing life as a student. I had so much planned, I
                            was looking forward to finally having no more homework and getting my self to Japan.
                            However, 2020 left us a running the annual theme of Covid pushing life back and that’s
                            exactly what happened. Although I finished school without issue and good grades I made a
                            grave miscalculation of the world’s situation due to my obsession with moving abroad.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When 2020 started and Covid ravened the world I was hopeful for the world’s scientists to
                            find a cure to end the disease. Although they made great strides in medicine, especially
                            with R-DNA vaccine’s becoming viable, it wasn’t enough to slow down the spread of the
                            disease to a point where the world could return to normal. As I approached my graduation
                            date I was staring depression in the face without knowing it, since I had been so obsessed
                            with moving to Japan after college for so long that when reality hit me in the face I had a
                            sense of despair slowly enshrouded me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During my last semester I spent most of my non-school time creating resumes, revising them,
                            applying for jobs, etc desperately trying to get a job. I knew that my Japanese was no where
                            near good enough to apply to most Japanese jobs and I knew if I had any chance at bringing
                            my dreams to fruition one day, I had to hunker down in America for some time to get both my
                            Japanese up to snuff and experience in software development as a whole.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then set a goal of 2024 (or 3 years at the time) to get to a proficient enough Japanese to
                            work; <a href="https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/index.html" target="_blank">JLPT N2</a>. Although I was sad that
                            I couldn’t find a job in Japan, depression hadn’t
                            fully encompassed me yet, but I did feel a sense of dread because finding a job was a
                            marathon of torture. I knew finding a job would be hard, I just didn’t know how hard it
                            would be. In the previous winter break I worked on Happy Ball as a resume builder but wasn’t
                            sure if it helped.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>My last computer setup before moving (November, 11th,
                                2020)</i></p>

                        <p>
                            In January I started with only a few applications towards jobs I really wanted. They were
                            near where I lived so that it’d be easy to commute from Rhode Island. However, as time went
                            on I learned as someone with no internship experience and non-related job experience I
                            couldn’t be picky about where I wanted to work. So then I slowly expanded more and more
                            until as a last ditch effort I throw out my job searching net to the entirety of the United
                            States; I was desperate to say the least.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I remember while attending a URI career meet online that getting myself out there, doing
                            prep interviews, and resume edits is what gets you a job. But nothing seemed to work…
                            eventually I had two emails from potential employers sending out code challenges. One being
                            Amazon and the other General Motors. The first code challenge I did was from GM where I had
                            to solve two “medium-ly” hard challenges, in which I thought I felt like I did terrible on
                            (but left a comment explaining how I’d solve it with more time). Then finally the Amazon
                            challenge where I had to solve 10 small questions in 30 minutes; of which I solved… 0.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After doing both coding challenges from the only two employers that I had a chance with, I
                            felt useless and defeated. Yet, one day I got an email from General Motors asking me to do a
                            phone interview. After talking for a bit the interviewer started asking questions about
                            moving for the job, possible locations, etc; after the phone call ended I got the offer. I
                            was blown away since I had not expected any company to send me an offer after the hundreds
                            of applications I threw into the wild. I was ecstatic however one concern I had was where I
                            was going to work. They told me to list my top three picks given their IT centers: Michigan,
                            Texas, Georgia, and Arizona. I didn’t want to move too far away so my top 3 where:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Georgia</li>
                            <li>Michigan</li>
                            <li>Texas</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Out of all my picks I got… Arizona…</p>

                        <p>
                            This was completely out of the blue and blew me away. Out of all the locations I gave them
                            the furthest and most different geographical location was the one I got. I remember seeing
                            pictures and videos of desert on the internet and always saying, “man who would ever want to
                            live there”; and now that place was going to be my new home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although I didn’t like where I was going to live I knew for the betterment of my career and
                            life as a whole I knew another opportunity wasn’t easy to come by, so I took the jump. My
                            job started May 24th of 2021 and my graduation was May 23rd. So the first week of May I
                            finished my last exams, packed all my things and my mother, step dad, & I drove my car all
                            the way from Rhode Island to Arizona.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before I moved however, I did try to tie up any lost of loose ends before I moved. My
                            friend’s threw a surprise farewell party to say their last goodbyes before I moved, I sold
                            any unneeded items online to make packing light, and backed up anything important to
                            hard-drives and the cloud.

                        <p>
                            In a sense I was “excited” to be able to see the country outside of New England for the
                            first time, but little did I know my psyche was not prepared for the whirlwind it was about
                            to experience. I was completely in a neutral mode to stay focused on the target of moving.
                            No emotions, no thinking about loved ones or family, etc; I didn’t want anything to distract
                            me until I was finished moving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had no idea this would bite back so hard, but at the time it was my mentality. I continued
                            anyways, hugged my dad and grandma goodbye, drove to my aunt’s to meet up with my mother;
                            then the next day drive off to Arizona. The drive there wasn’t particularly exciting, we
                            stopped for lunch in New York then drove all the way to Indianapolis where we stayed at a
                            hotel for a night. The next day we drove down all the way through Missouri, Oklahoma, the
                            tip of Texas, New Mexico, and finally Arizona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I arrived at my apartment my step dad drove us to the Grand Canyon. I thought I would
                            of been excited since I love Geology but I really wasn’t too impressed since although I
                            hadn’t seen it, I already know “how” it was made. I learned that day I guess I’m a really
                            bad tourist.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once we were done with seeing the grand canyon we drove all the way down to my apartment and
                            finally got me settled in. This was after a stressful day of moving in early, calling
                            insurance companies, power companies, internet companies, etc to finally get inside my new
                            home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that I was there, I thought that it would of been smooth sailing since I brought my
                            necessities, games, etc. That was the polar opposite of what happened, the depression that
                            was brewing up before I moved had finally got to it’s breaking point.

                            It wasn’t until I sat down on the empty floor with my computer while my mom & step-dad were
                            out for a bit that I realized how <i>alone</i> I was. I sat in silence for a good few
                            minutes, then
                            just broken down bawling. I had this idea in my head before moving that I was essentially,
                            “moving from my old life to my new one”, graduating from school to me was transitioning from
                            one part of life to the next. So when I got to Arizona and had a few hours of silence
                            <b>alone</b>
                            I thought to myself, “Is this it? Is this the rest of my life?”

                            Although I know that I’ll a long life ahead of me, all I could think of at the time was that
                            life was just <i>empty</i> after school. The reason why I thought this way was because I’m a
                            very
                            goal oriented person, meaning that school had been my abstract long term goal my entire
                            life. Now that the goal had been completed, what was next? I still had the lifelong dream of
                            moving to Japan, but it’s not like being in Japan is going to be <i>that</i> different from
                            where I
                            am in Arizona. Sure the culture may be different, the language, etc; but I still have to
                            wake up, go to a job, come home, repeat until retirement.

                            My mother and step father came back and I was trying to hold my composure at first and talk
                            about how uncomfortable I was. This proved too hard and I quickly burst out crying. This was
                            new for me since I <i>never</i> cry or show intense emotions to my family… <b>ever</b>. Even
                            though I had
                            never been taught to repress emotions, I’d self-taught myself to feel that way because I
                            <b>do not like bothering others</b>. This emotional breakdown was so intense that I couldn’t
                            bear to
                            hold it in; I told them how alone I was going to be and they decided to stay for an extra
                            week on top of their original one week plan.

                            During my first week in Arizona we went shopping for furniture, kitchen supplies, food, you
                            name it. This did not help with my stress at all because I hadn’t started my job yet and
                            knew I wasn’t going to get paid until a while later. So spending around $2000+ and digging
                            into my savings wasn’t the greatest feeling. To add insult to injury I moved out to Arizona
                            the first week of May in order to settle down before my job started, so I didn’t even know
                            if I graduated. Although my grades were high in all my classes, I had one teacher who
                            notoriously didn’t grade papers until months after; and I feverishly checked everyday until
                            I knew that my grade in my writing class was passable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before I started work however I had another 10 days, so I tried to get myself organized and
                            on one of the days I had to bring my mom and step dad back to the airport. That day was the
                            saddest I’d ever felt in my entire life, seeing the only two people I knew in thousands of
                            miles disappear into the crowd. I drove to the DMV to get my Arizona License and went back
                            home, completely drain and tired. I looked at the inflatable bed they used to sleep on while
                            they were here and felt their prescience still there. One night I even closed the door
                            saying “goodnight”, even though I knew there weren’t there. I tried to do other things like
                            play games to distract myself but there were too many thoughts in my head to do anything.

                        <p>
                            In the past I’ve had small depressive episodes (especially in the summer time), but adding a
                            major depressive episode, seasonal depression, and essentially the “loss” of loved ones
                            disabled me for a few days. I’d never had a panic attack in my life before but I felt as if
                            I had a few throughout the course of 2 weeks. I’d be sitting there trying to do something
                            simple like watch a video, talk to friends, or play a game; then out of no where I felt
                            scared of nothing, didn’t feel safe, and want to curl up in fear.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I kept in contact with my mother and grandmother over email but it didn’t help whatsoever. I
                            tried just pushing through and when I started my job I thought some of the stress would go
                            away but I thought wrong. Work wasn’t hard but for someone like me with massive imposter
                            syndrome this adds another layer of stress. I didn’t know what exactly I was doing at work,
                            felt like I was doing nothing (yet still being praised by people there), and like a complete
                            fraud.

                        <p>
                            I kept up this life for several months (around 2-3) until one day I wrote an extensive email
                            to my mother talking about how I’ve been thinking of my life. I told her how depressed I was
                            and told here my thought of “is this really it?”. Where I talk about my growing old and
                            everyone in the family dying off leaving just me, my cousins, and brother left. I told her
                            how sad that made me and how me being so far away just makes me feel like I’ll have no one
                            left in old age. At first she was concern of me being suicidal, but I quickly told her that
                            because I don’t believe in an afterlife that although my life may depressing; I’d rather
                            life <i>some life</i> than <i>no life</i>. I did at one point call the suicide hotline, but
                            realized that
                            it was almost useless since they already just told me what I knew anyways… I was lonely not
                            suicidal.

                        <p>
                            She ended up sending it to my grandmother and I got a hold of almost everyone in my family
                            over the phone for a good 2-3 weeks. At first I didn’t talk too much since I had a hard time
                            expressing emotion with my family, since I’d never done it in my life before. But after
                            being so frustrated with myself I finally gave up and just dumped all of my emotions over
                            the phone to everyone. I finally gave everyone the “I love you” that I hadn’t given
                            sincerely since I was an elementary school kid.

                        <p>
                            I talked with my dad, grandmother, and mom for hours on end; even some for half the day. It
                            was essentially a life-line support to keep my mental health in check because I was afraid I
                            might of gone insane. Once I talked with everyone in my family I started to feel a little
                            bit better, but still had depressive episodes. My uncle sent me his PlayStation to keep in
                            touch with him and I ended up playing Elder Scrolls Online for 5-6 months with my dad, him,
                            and one of their online friends.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I kept up these conversations every so often and I still keep in touch with my grandmother
                            on the phone once every 2 weeks even now. But at the time I still had bouts of depression
                            that could take over my day and immobilize me. I tried seeking therapy but for months I
                            couldn’t find any office or building that wasn’t already maxed out for months on end.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At this point I was getting extremely anxious and depressed, until one day I was notified
                            about Tele-doc and their online therapy sessions from my work insurance. At first I was
                            skeptical, but tried it anyways since it was better than nothing. I booked an appointment
                            and went to my first couple of sessions. I learned a lot in the first sessions, the biggest
                            boon my therapist gave me was medical words and terminology that put a word to the feelings
                            that I had been expressing. I told her my life story and she helped me realize what was a
                            leading force in my depression outside of uneasiness that moving away from friends and
                            family does. Lack of confidence in myself, catastrophizing, <i>possibly</i> PDD (Persistent

                            Over time with more talks I started to feel better and improve. Work became more routine in
                            that I knew what I had to do for the day, I had my stores where I shopped at, I got myself a
                            dentist to fix my dental issues, etc. I started to turn my mood in a better direction and I
                            got into a nice routine.

                        <p>
                            Eventually during the summer my brother visited me and we did a few activities over a week
                            end; which put me in a better mood for a bit. Then later in the year I planned two trips:
                            one to Rhode Island for thanksgiving to visit my family, and the other in Georgia to visit
                            my mom, step dad, and other grandparents.

                            I stayed in my nice routine until I got to November to saw my family back home. I was weird
                            at first being at home but adjusted well, I saw a few of my close friends and enjoyed
                            feeling a sense of seasons changing (there isn’t really any seasons in Arizona). I went back
                            home after my nice trip back from Rhode Island to then on a plane again 2 weeks later to
                            visit my mom in Georgia. That trip however, was not as wonderful…

                            places, and my mom and I talked about history for a while. But I planned a 2 week vacation
                            there and soon became more depressed that I wasn’t in Arizona. Some days we didn’t do
                            anything the entire day and I was uncomfortable being a new area that I’d never been to
                            before. I started to think about my life again and when my mom and I walked at a local
                            school’s track I told her the reason I keep getting depressed. I told her that although I
                            can have a nice job, live somewhere that I want to be at, etc etc that life just feels so
                            empty. She didn’t really have much for words but it wasn’t that out of the ordinary for me;
                            since even when I lived with her in high school I had the same bleak outlook. Suffice to say
                            I <i>wanted</i> to go back to Arizona and although I love my mom I couldn’t wait to be back
                            at what
                            I now considered home.

                        <p>
                            When I came back to my apartment I was lucky that Halo Infinite’s campaign had just come out
                            and that sucked me into something for a good month. January to March of 2022 was the
                            happiest I’d ever felt in years surprisingly and I did a lot in that time. I started to
                            really hone in on what I saw were my faults in my Japanese and really grilled myself hard on
                            doing it right. I set out new years goals of: reaching level 30 in <a
                                href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank">Wanikani</a>, finishing all
                            my Anki Decks (flash card program) for my old Japanese text books, and getting all the N5-N3
                            grammar points memorized on BunPro by the end of the year. Even if you don’t know anything
                            about learning Japanese or what I just mentioned, I’ll say it’s a lot.

                            But since I’m a very goal oriented person, I set out on that goal and ever since then to

                            alone that having a goal no matter how big or small is good for my mind it keeps me active
                            and focused. If I ever lose focus I know depression will gladly greet me.

                            That’s where I stand today, although this post may seem like I end on a bad note I will
                            state that I’m doing much better than I was when I first moved here. That and I’m making
                            steps to improve my life physically and mentally. I take walks at my local park and gym, I
                            engage with my Japanese study to keep my skills up, and have recently just revisited my
                            therapist after a year to really nail down the last few depressive thoughts that have been
                            bothering me. I’ve given up on giving into depression and I want to improve my life for the
                            better, I’m not living my life in sadness anymore… I’m done.
