                            So… yeah it has been about a little under a year since I’ve posted to this website. I think
                            I stated somewhere that I’m not good at this “blog” or “news” thing. Nevertheless I have
                            some important news! Now that I’ve completed my first semester at the University of Rhode
                            Island (URI) I’m now in full swing in starting my improvement to my programming knowledge.
                            Before URI I had only seldom coding practice mainly self teaching for a couple years and a
                            little bit of C#, C++, and Python at the Community College of Rhode Island but not enough to
                            mean too much. I actually feel challenged at times and am learning at very fast pace! I went
                            from only being able to make a C++ simple puzzle maze in a year to solving a randomized
                            Sudoku puzzles, recreating the Game of Life, and 3×3 puzzle swapper game.

                        <p>
                            Towards the end of my fall semester in December I had a friend who worked for his friend’s
                            garbage company and he was having a hassle putting in customer data into a giant program
                            that cost a $100 yearly subscription to use. I asked him what he needed to do and all he
                            said was customer names, phones, payments, etc. Just put in data and display it. I thought
                            to myself, this is the mundane class and array type problems we solve at schools! So I
                            offered him to make the program and in only 3 restless nights I created a program from
                            scratch. It was then that I realized that when put under pressure I can accomplish things I
                            wouldn’t think I’d be able to. Obviously it’s improved over time recently so that the
                            program looks nicer and functions easier, since when I sent over the first iteration for him
                            to start putting customers into, it was a mess! The only thing I need to do now to call it a
                            complete product is encrypting data, since that stuff needs to be secret! I just haven’t
                            encountered using encryption yet in my coding career yet so I’m learning how to implement it
                            in the program now. Thankfully the company isn’t a high target powerhouse so even though I
                            wanted to encrypt it from the get-go he needed it quick, so I had to make the initial
                            sacrifice to security for usability. But other than that, I call it my first ever
                            functioning program, that isn’t a school project or test program. I made a functioning C#
                            WPF music player for myself but I have yet to cache the song locations for faster loading
                            since again I don’t have experience with caching. But if that were to be solved, I’d have
                            another completed project!

                            The same goes for Japanese since before URI I can only read Hiragana and Katakana, now I can
                            write those two (Katakana gives me some trouble still) and Kanji! Plus I know some simple
                            sentence structure! Before September the most I could “communicate” in Japanese was
                            <code>「こんにちは、わたしはおーすていんです」</code> which isn’t even correct. Since my name would been in
                            Katakana and I
                            can use Kanji to replace “I” or 「わたし」 in my sentence. So <code>「私はオースティンデスです」</code> would
                            be correct.
                            Plus, like I said I can now at least communicate at a somewhat comprehensible level,
                            <code>「きずみさんはぱんを食べました。私も食べました。」</code> is <code>“Kizumi ate bread, I also ate bread”</code>.
                            My end of the sentence is
                            shorter since in Japanese if I’m using も which indicates that I’m also doing the action of
                            the last statement. Also instead of using です to state a current event I used でした a polite
                            past tense form of です to indicate presence. I could go on hours about Japanese grammar and
                            tense now that I learned the basics. But I think my learning ability in Japanese has been
                            growing quickly is due to the fact that I don’t just go to the class, learn, then go home.
                            I’ve been fully assaulting my brain with Japanese: going to after-school a Japanese speaking
                            hour, studying Kanji using <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">Wanikani</a>, and etc. The
                            same goes for my programming: spending
                            hours of free time doing assignments, personal projects, and etc. When I got a month off of
                            school between Fall and Spring semester I had no idea to do with myself, I feel like my
                            brain needs forced stimulation (aka. work and school) otherwise I just go insane.

                            So where does that leave me now? Well I’m starting up my Spring 2020 semester and am
                            continuing my Japanese and Programming study so I hope to improve them both immensely over
                            time. I’m also working on Taurus intermittently since I have a plan for the game and have
                            working power-up systems in the game. All I should need for it to be a complete game is
                            levels. But knowing myself I’ll spend hours making a customizable ship screen, player
                            editor, and etc. But I’m forcing myself to finish the game then add minor stuff later. I
                            already have the assets, I just need the drive to make some levels and we are good to go!
                            I’ve already seen my mood increase after going back to school again so I hope it drive me to
                            finally finish this forsaken project! So I hope to see it on the Steam shop by the end of
                            the year!
