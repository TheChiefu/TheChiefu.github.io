                            Today starts the beginning of an unplanned yet exciting journey. “What is that journey” you
                            ask? Well, starting today I (Austin Lanphear) have decided to create a website that acts as
                            both a personal website where I can update on personal topics but also a landing page for
                            Japanese learners to access useful resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve had a personal website for a while but never really did anything with it because it was
                            basically just a digital resume, which LinkedIn basically does anyways. So I’ve decided
                            after the 4 years I’ve had it that I’ll just transfer the old posts to this website under my
                            “Personal Blog” tag and just keep any updates about my personal self there. The difference
                            this time around on this website is that I still can use it as a personal website but now
                            have more use of it as a utility for both myself and others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s a personal utility because I can put non-sensitive information like my preferred
                            programs lists (for when I reinstall/install an OS to new computers), game ideas /
                            white-boarding, etc on the website without needing to create copious amounts of backups to
                            my
                            phone, google drive, etc. Since all the managing of the data is done by WordPress and their
                            servers; so I don’t have to worry about copying/using old backups or whatever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s also a utility for others since I can provide a place for learners (of anything really,
                            but primarily Japanese) a central place to gather and use resources from. One being just a
                            place of general links and two being my review/critique of resources. I personally believe
                            writing about the resources with their pros/cons is useful since a info-dump of random links
                            doesn’t really mean anything if you have no idea what they are even for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An example of a review would be something like this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <div
                            style="background-color: rgb(230, 230, 230); color: black; padding: 1%; border-radius: 5px;">
                            <p>
                                Wanikani – A Kanji learning platform where you start on a predefined track of kanji and
                                vocabulary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pros: Covers all of the Joyo-kanji, plus 6600 words
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cons: Predefined track of Kanji/Vocabulary you have to take in order independent of
                                current Japanese level
                            </p>

                            This removes any ambiguity of what each resource and link is about since I tell you
                            <b>how</b> and
                            <b>why</b> I listed it in the first place. As a software developer I know from experience
                            how
                            infuriating bad documentation or no documentation is. So when I suggest resources or
                            information to people I want to make sure they are well information to make their use of the
                            information easier to digest.

                            Well that pretty much wraps up the first introductory post to this website, have fun
                            browsing. The website may be incredibly sparse for a few days as I set everything up and get
                            my writing brain in order, but I intend to update it frequently for the first month or so.
