                        <h2>​My first rodeo in Game Design</h2>

                        <p>
                            ​Reclamation was a project of inspiration, hope, and regret. Why regret?
                            Well many reasons can contribute to my feeling of regret on the project
                            but lets focus on what happened in the development of the project first.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a new semester in my final year of public schooling, my Computer
                            Technology & Game Design class had been pretty stagnant for the 2 & 1/2
                            years I’d been there and all we essentially did there was copy code from
                            what our teacher gave us into a Dark Basic Pro; a really old game engine
                            without outdated architecture. One of my friends even considered dropping
                            the class because it had been so stagnant; but then a ray of hope came down,
                            our new computer tech teacher had finally been brought in. I really didn’t
                            know what to expect at first honestly, after being in such a drab class
                            for so long I kept skeptical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was until he sat us down and asked us what WE wanted to do instead of
                            assigning us busy work that I started to enjoy the class. Before we even
                            started the game he had us sit down and watch the movie “The Wizard”,
                            mostly because it reminded him of our childhood but it gave us a
                            breather from the previously mundane tasks of the class of old.
                            His big lesson before letting us roam free with the possibility of
                            creating a game idea was to emphasize the importance of gameplay over
                            graphics, an ideology I agree with completely. We were given a good
                            week of relaxing time due to the mid-terms in the rest of our classes,
                            then we all sat together to come up with a game-plan on what to do
                            for the rest of the year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ​He suggested we come up with a game concept that we can present
                            to the director of the Career and Technical center of our school
                            to show off how the class had improved from how it used to be run.
                            The first thing we did was plan out when certain steps had to be
                            completed: step one was conceptualization, step two development,
                            and finally step three presentation. We had a date when we had
                            to present the concept of our game to the director and we started
                            on working. Not after a hilarious naming for our “company”, which
                            was a joke created by one of our team-mates.
                            The name was “Lardhard”, which came from the polar opposite of
                            the 10th grader’s “company” name of “Oceansoft”; we laughed the
                            joke off at first but since nobody could agree on a name we kept
                            the name “Landhard”.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most of the team was directed to work on creating artwork for the
                            game, such as creature drawings, world map concepts, and the like.
                            Two of our members created music and sound for the game, one
                            focusing on music and the other sound effects. One person was
                            supposed to be the project lead but it ended being about 2/3
                            people when certain people were absent. Others were tasked with
                            creating how the control scheme would be if it were released,
                            some creating gameplay mechanic ideas, and then I was tasked
                            with creating an interactive demo from pulling in all the ideas
                            from the team into the project.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Image Gallery -->

                        <p>
                            Although all we had to do was create essentially PowerPoint of
                            ideas and present them to one of our administrators at school,
                            I really wanted to force myself to really learn game design and
                            learn the inner-workings of a game engine. So even though at the
                            time it felt fun and often times frustrating it really helped me
                            out in the long-run. I learned how to implement UI sliders from
                            Unity in (I know <b>​​​advanced​</b> right?), change weather controls which
                            could be easily implemented in random weather conditions, natural
                            time-of-day progression, etc. I’ve always wanted to create an
                            open world Zelda type game ever since I was in Elementary school
                            (kind of like Breath of the Wild before it came out) and this
                            was my opportunity to learn a bit on how to design one. If I
                            ever find my original designs I’d gladly share them here.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ​However, once the time came we scrambled together a Google Slides
                            and presented it to the director of the technical center and she
                            loved it, since before the class was literally Photoshop your
                            face on a celebrity and create pong. She loved the connection
                            of artistic ideas with technical skills in order to create art.
                            Okay enough for the back-padding… This was essentially the
                            practice run for the real presentation at the end of the year.
                            It started out as a simple presentation to the staff but it
                            gradually turned into the local news showing up, and the
                            superintendent were going to be there.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I gradually got more agitated however, not only because I felt
                            like the pressure was on but that we’re not going to make an
                            actual game rather a concept. Granted I still enjoyed creating
                            the landscape and concept of the game but I didn’t want to
                            falsely excite people into creating the next Skyrim. It was
                            mostly because I knew the pressure would be on me and a friend
                            because we’re really the only ones how now how to code and
                            partly 3D model. I don’t want to bad-mouth my friend/peers,
                            I loved the idea we created but I didn’t have the confidence
                            that we’d be able to actually create the grand-idea for the
                            game; creating a game idea is easy but putting one together
                            is a different beast all on its own.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ​Weeks past of development and the days were counting down, the
                            project was nearing completion and we had to focus on getting
                            all of us together to write a presentation script and slideshow.
                            Most people shifted focus to writing their pieces of the
                            presentation, starting with the story to art, music, gameplay
                            mechanics, marketing, etc. While this was coming to fruition
                            and I was hard-work finishing up the interactive demo for the
                            presentation; I reworked it because there were tons of bugs
                            that needed to be fixed. The demo was originally supposed to
                            give people the ability to walk around the town or at least fly
                            around but due to an error in Unity’s physics that I didn’t
                            know how to fix would clip the only the player through the
                            terrain. I then found out the presentation wouldn’t really
                            allow us the time to have people “play” it so I created a
                            multi-camera system in which the Alphanumeric keys changed the
                            camera to static positions. In the end this was the better
                            decision since it allowed for people to visualize the story
                            since each camera angle had a connection to the story enhancing
                            the experience.

                        <p>
                            Finally the presentation day, everyone’s hard-work could finally
                            come together and be presented to an audience. We had to scramble
                            last minute to get everything to work properly, the projector
                            used in our school’s library had a mind of its own and would
                            work whenever it wanted to but we had luck on our side that day.
                            I brought in my personal computer since non of the MacBook Airs
                            the school had could run the game. I brought two monitors from
                            our class room and hid them behind a presenter podium, both
                            vertical. One mirroring the projector so I could see what the
                            audience is seeing and the bottom off-screen to prepare music,
                            script transitions, etc that I needed to know about without
                            distracting the audience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ​We presented the game and the reception was phenomenal! I’m no
                            social butterfly but I genuinely had a fun time, two strangers
                            from the audience that seemed to be 2 years younger walked up
                            to me and asked about the development process and actually had
                            something to teach someone about, which I never do. In conclusion,
                            although I dreaded some parts of the process I felt proud of my
                            work since it taught me good lessons of game design, experience
                            working with a team and deadline on when the game needed to be
                            done, and most importantly something to work forward to in the
                            future; a more grandiose picture of what games I want to make.
                            That goal right now… is to make Taurus a reality and not just a
                            homemade project to have fun with my friends.
