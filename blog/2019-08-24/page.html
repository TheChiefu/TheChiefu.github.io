                        <p>
                            I’m going to be honest and state right off the bat that I completely forgot about this site
                            for a bit. I think in an earlier blog post I said I’m not good at keeping up with things I
                            post online up to date. But nevertheless I’m posting today about some very crucial changes
                            I’ve been making not only to Taurus but to my personal life that effect my development
                            process.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Making Amends to Myself:</h3>
                        <p>
                            So one big issue I have with doing any project is keep up with it. I always go full throttle
                            into a new project whenever I’m in good spirits and I keep up with that until inevitably and
                            understandably get burnt out. I’ve known about this issue of going balls to the wall (as
                            coined in 1960s aviation) for a long time; 2015 or so. Back when I was working on my
                            campsite in my aunt’s backyard. I’m in “go go go” mode until I hit a hurdle; then I try to
                            figure out the hurdle but in the process of figuring out how to overcome the hurdle I tire
                            myself out. Sometimes I overcome the hurdle and sometimes I don’t, but either way I’m too
                            mentally tired to continue after I overcome it. Then when I come back to the project I
                            either have no idea what I was doing and don’t know how to go back to a project without
                            restarting or just give up.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Burn Out and Multiple Ventures:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Taurus is a prime example of this phenomenon; starting, restarting, stopping again,
                            restarting, ever since 2017 on and off. I’ve heard good advice to never or try not to start
                            multiple projects but I can never seem to follow that advice. Since I have so many ideas
                            floating around in my head that I don’t want to throw away, I always write them down, start
                            a new project, or etc; and in the process I start numerous projects and to this day have
                            never finished any. Privately I’ve been working experimentally on a Halo-type shooter but
                            for a bit I messed around with NavMesh components in Unity for AI navigation since I figured
                            that multiplayer games are infinitely more complicated than single-player (in terms of
                            programming for me) and wanted to work on an “easier” project.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Too Many Projects:</h3>
                        <p>​
                            During June or so of this year I worked on and off making an AI cylinder move around some
                            platforms, made an animated character for the player, and messed around with custom physics
                            in Unity of Gravity Zones (zones in which I can lower or raise gravity in a particular
                            zones). It was all fun but I never had any drive to actually do anything with it, so
                            occasionally I add things here and there but I never made a conscious decision to stay and
                            work on it. On top of that I was writing my own music player in Windows for my own music
                            listening pleasure (I love VLC but it doesn’t have the ability to play all music from a
                            specific genre to my knowledge). Then on top of those two projects I was trying to get
                            motion capture from a Kinect a friend gave me to make custom animations for Unity and also
                            face scans of my friend to put into the game. But that effort was quickly shot down after
                            how I couldn’t find a single free solution to get Kinect MoCap data to work in Blender or
                            Unity so I gave up on that, as for the 3D scans I got super hires models but the textures
                            couldn’t be extracted…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make things even worse, I thought it was a good idea for some reason to try and make an
                            entire Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time remake in unity. Since I thought: “all of the
                            textures, models, sound, and stuff is all existing content so all I need to do it piece it
                            together!” So I worked on the on-screen text stuff, UI, elements, and it was going
                            swimmingly, then you guessed it! Burn Out! That and the thought of all this work for myself
                            wasn’t worth it and a DMCA from Nintendo being already scary. If I can’t share it with
                            everyone online why even do it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suffice to say I’ve started too many things and never finished a single one… so this is
                            where my new “plan” comes into fruition. Since I know I go in cycles of inspiration to
                            discouragement I am going to work on a game so simple I couldn’t possibly be hit with
                            massive hurdles like Taurus and my other projects have.

                        <h3>Original Taurus:</h3>
                        <p>
                            My idea is making the very original Taurus, not the ones I’ve updated on here the very
                            original one I made a “Development” video of here. The so simple that I didn’t want to
                            originally work on it since it was “too easy” for me back when I had the concept. But little
                            did I know back in 2017 that advancing my ideas for Taurus to make a bigger & better game
                            without actually making a functioning base game is a terrible idea. Since obviously I never
                            have made a finished game before, just working concepts. I explained in an earlier post how
                            my burn out of Taurus was due to my ideas getting bigger and out of my conceptional grasp.
                            This time I’m using my already created ideas back from 2017 in which I have a power-point
                            from when I was in High-School of and making a working simple game. I don’t care when/if i
                            finish it only has a single sale on Steam as long as I have a finished game under my belt
                            that I self-developed and self-published I can sleep soundly at night.

                        <h3>Concluding Thoughts:</h3>
                        <p>
                            My obsession with finishing & publishing a games comes from my personal perception that it’s
                            a really terrible look to want to go into game/software development & not have a single
                            program made. Yes I’ve made simple C++ command prompt games at school & such but those
                            barely count as “completed work” or “work experience”. I want to have a single game that is
                            of my own creation to be finished and published. My perfectionist attitude has been my
                            undoing for years, that and my cycles in inspiration and degradation.

                                    I’ll probably disappear for another year or so, but either way I wanted to post here
                                    as a therapeutic way to put in “paper” my intentions and get myself into the mood to
                                    pull myself out of my development rut. Since this entire summer I haven’t steadily
                                    worked on a project unlike 2017 and 2018.

                                    Don’t think that the post is written since I am sad or depressed though, I’m just
                                    disappointed in my work ethic towards personal projects. In general life has been
                                    really good; so good I’d say it’s been the best 2 years of my life. Having the best
                                    job ever as a bus monitor was a welcome surprise, finally being done with math was a
                                    weight off my shoulder, and playing/hanging out with friends is always fun. Even now
                                    this coming Fall I’m finally learning Japanese academically and not online by
                                    myself; which I had a terrible time keeping myself to do consistently.
