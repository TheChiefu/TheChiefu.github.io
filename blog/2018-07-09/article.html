                        <p>
                            Times goes by real quick doesn’t it..? Well, I noticed that my last update was in January at
                            the beginning of this year and thought to myself, “I probably should write an update on what
                            I’ve been up to”. So here it goes…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            College and Work in tandem has been a sure way of taking up as much time as humanly
                            possible. It hasn’t been until recently (the Summer) that I have time to work on my game, or
                            mentally inspired enough to do so. For the better part of this year I’ve been in the cycle
                            of: wake up, go to work, come back tired, do school work, spend some free time, go to bed,
                            repeat. So my interest in making my game hasn’t been that high, despite that dis-interest in
                            making the game itself I don’t think I’ll ever lose my interest in completing the game ever.
                            It’s just been that I’ve been busy “learning” at college and saving up money for my future
                            at work, I also go though cycles of inspiration and laziness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that I described in older posts that I go in cycles of inspiration droughts, where
                            for a couple of weeks I’m all hyped to add features into my game, writing down notes, adding
                            story elements, etc. Then when I inedible burn myself out I spend at least a month doing
                            absolutely nothing: watching YouTube, playing Video Games, and browsing the internet for
                            useless facts. The odd contradiction is that while I can be in these inspiration droughts I
                            want to do something productive but feel overwhelmed in doing so. An example being in summer
                            of last year when I got into the game NieR: Automata. I really loved the game and since it
                            was a long game I’d play it all night until I felt tired. Then the next morning I’d want to
                            play it really bad, but something was stopping me. Nothing physically stopping me, but that
                            I just didn’t want to do it for some reason. In my head I wanted to see what happened next
                            in the story, but I had to force myself to get into it, yet when I was in it I was hooked.
                            Similarly, this is what it’s been like to do anything as of late: wanting to get into a
                            game, working on my game, and etc. I don’t know why I do it, but I do; and I’m trying to
                            improve.

                            Where does that leave me now? Well, since the summer started a week ago for public schools
                            and my work (Bus Monitoring) doesn’t go all year I have the time off. This is a boon and a
                            curse, since I get to have as much time as I can focusing on working on my game; which I’ve
                            been wanting to do as of late (going in another inspiration cycle). However, this is bad
                            since when I have so much time off I do everything I wanted to do and get extremely bored.
                            And when I get bored, I do nothing! (Counter-intuitive right?) In the summers I usually
                            force myself to hang out with one of my friends, do things outside, and occupy my mind since
                            even though I want to work on my game, cramming new information about things such as C#
                            Networking, Unity’s UNET, etc takes time to process and I shouldn’t try to force myself into
                            burn out. Technically I still do have school since I am taking summer classes but instead of
                            a normal school year in college (5-6 Classes at once), it’s just one class every 5-6 weeks
                            so it’s not intrusive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So what about the game? Like I stated earlier in this post, I have been working on it
                            recently but just yesterday I’ve hit a massive roadblock. I want to add multiplayer to my
                            game so that my friends and I can mess around in the game. The problem being is that there
                            are so many ways to implement multiplayer in Unity it’s actually dumb and really unhelpful.
                            I can use Unity’s built-in networking code using the UNET and the HLAP but I don’t know how
                            to use the networking code well, and all tutorials online usually end with it working only
                            on LAN connections, which is not what I’m trying to accomplish. I know there are third party
                            server software that are offered in the Asset Store like Proton, but unfortunately that
                            service uses the Proton’s network to offer multiplayer. It’s nice and all but when their
                            servers go down, my game will be affected so I dismissed that option. So that leaves me with
                            P2P and Dedicated Server functionality. The problem with this solution is that its
                            functionally exactly what I wanted, but the tutorials I followed lead me to a wall where a
                            player can join, yet the movement on each game client isn’t synced to the server, and I
                            don’t know how to sync it. I want to use’s Steam’s P2P networking to further link Steam
                            services to my game for ease of use, but the Steamwork’s documentation has a bit to be
                            desired and there are no public videos showing how to use it (I’m still a complete beginner
                            to networking).

                        <p>
                            After bashing my head at the wall trying to figure out networking and linking it to Unity I
                            tried taking time off of that and trying out something new instead. I heard that Unity will
                            eventually be going away from GameObjects, Monobehaviors, and the like for a more Data
                            Oriented approach; allowing multi threading! But it requires essentially relearning how to
                            code C# in Unity (not all of it but pretty close). And this is where I come to another
                            impasse, should I stick to the old way I know (Object Oriented / Monobehaviors) or go to
                            the more optimized Hybrid-ECS / Pure ECS system so that I get more out of multi-core CPUs
                            which everyone has nowadays. Unfortunately, since I’m a perfectionist in my work I want to
                            do the “very optimized/best performance” way, but since the systems are still in Beta aren’t
                            fully available make it hard for me to want to do it the new way and have something
                            change/break on update.

                            And this leads me to my last problem, too big and too grandeur. Taurus used to be a small
                            project that my friend and I created as a school project in a competition. Essentially what
                            it was, was a Star-Fox clone that was on-rails space shooter with enemies spawning in very
                            specific patterns dependent on the level. Taurus is nothing like that anymore, it’s an open
                            arena shooter, with a branching story, 2-16 matchmaking multiplayer, a ship-editor, and much
                            more. My demand for high quality games and not settling for less has left me in a hard
                            position. Obviously, if I could do what I could do in my imagination the game would be this
                            amazing game, but obviously reality isn’t that kind; and what I’m trying to accomplish is
                            for the most part done with teams of people. Since, I’m only one person I think I need to
                            tone down what I’m trying to accomplish with this game. I started writing down the script of
                            the story a while back, and I don’t want to write the story with the constraints that I have
                            so that I can build it in the quality I want to and learn. But, since I’m terrible at 3D
                            modeling I’m left at yet <b>another</b> impasse! I want to making the story engaging but
                            it’s hard to tell a story if you’re game is made out of cubes and primitive shapes. So on
                            top of learning networking coding and Hybrid-ECS for Unity I have to learn modeling people
                            in 3D to achieve my goal and that is a lot to take in. I need to come up with a game plan…
                            and set the bar lower for myself, since at this rate I’ll never finish the game.

                            But hey here’s the upside… At least I haven’t given up yet! And I won’t! I always wanted to
                            make a video game and I’m not letting my first one be a train-wreck. It’s also a nice
                            portfolio item if I want to work in the gaming industry. Since I know it’s better to have
                            some experience proven rather than nothing, and I sure as hell know I’m not going to be able
                            to move abroad after college if I have zero experience in the industry (no one hires a
                            complete newbie). It’s not the only reason I’m making the game, I actually really enjoy
                            making the game; but sometimes it’s a real pain…
