              The website is now live! Come one come all, to the extravagant inner workings of a mad-man…
              well depending on the day. Some days are more professional than others. Nevertheless,
              my website is open to the public after several hours of finding a good enough website that
              won’t butcher the url with their name (it’s a repetitive I have; I’m looking at you freewebs and wix).
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is for any news about any games I am working on, planning to work on, and/or ramblings
              on what I’m doing related to gaming. I’ve been working on a game called <b>Taurus</b> for about little
              over
              a month and it’s been going fantastic! I wanted to make sure I got the word out about it since
              there’s no sense trying to make a game if nobody is going to play it. I’ve been developing it with
              Unity <b><i>(whoa hold your horses Unity can be good if put in the right hands)</i></b> to get it started
              alongside
              the Steamworks SDK to steam features can work straight from the get-go.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game itself as it is being developed today was only started like I said about a month ago
              but the concept of the game stems back to late 2016 where a friend and I were tasked with
              making a tiny game for a contest in school. It acted more of a Starfox type of game being on
              rails where enemies spawn off-screen until you finish the level. Here is a very early video of
              the game back then.

              I know bad right? I was never really that great with 3D modeling, I’ve usually stick to level
              design and coding for the most part. But the game has changed drastically from that point in late 2016.
              Once June came around I continued the same project from the 2016 version but a hard-drive failure
              took place soon after and had to start all over. At the time I was losing my mind because all
              the work was lost but what I didn’t know is that the past months gave me the experience I need to
              start fresh with a better idea. Here is how the game looks now after little less than a month of work.
              (3D Models are from the Asset Store since I’m horrid at it; luckily the pieces are modular so it’s
              like Halo’s Forge).

              There we go, a lot more visually appealing than last time! Most of the development this time was
              getting everything down and easy to remember. When I was developing the first version of the game
              I was still getting used to how to even call other game object’s components which was a disaster.
              Now most of the time is been dedicated to getting the game setup, so once I create a new level I
              can essentially “drag and drop” enemies where I want them to spawn, create objective points similarly,
              and etc. The longest part is making sure it all works in tandem with one another. Once the mechanics
              are in place, that’s when script writing goes into overdrive. However its still a long way from that
              point, but I’m very confident that the game will be enjoyable, because the more time and effort I put
              in the more ideas I get. It always helps to when friends and peers aid with advice as well; and now
              that the information is online, some constructive criticism here can also help.
            </p>

              That’s enough with my ramblings, if you want to help support the one-manned project I will eventually
              create a Kickstarter page further in development but if you want to help you can donate at the bottom
              of this article. If not, wait for any updates here on the News section to hear more on the development
              side of things.
