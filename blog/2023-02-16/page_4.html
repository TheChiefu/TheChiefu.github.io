                        <h2 id="t4">Fixing My Minecraft Worlds</h2>
                        <p>
                            This one came up relatively recently but was something I thought was impossible for the
                            longest time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back in middle school I used to play Minecraft a lot and would always be the one who hosted
                            the worlds for friends to join on. By doing so I had the world files but couldn’t do much
                            since at the time PC and Xbox 360 Minecraft were incompatible with each other. Years went by
                            and I eventually transferred my worlds to my Xbox One edition of the game. Even still I was
                            stuck with them on that version.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Years went by and I always wanted to play them on my PC but knew I couldn’t, since console
                            and PC Minecraft weren’t compatible. However over time Microsoft made updates to the game
                            and made a cross-play version of the game. Minecraft “Bedrock” was a cross-play version of
                            the game that made it so PC and Consoles could play together. I still couldn’t play on my
                            Xbox worlds on PC since on Xbox One there was no way to copy your save files.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t4-1">Realms</h3>
                        <p>
                            So my worlds were still locked to console no matter what I did, eventually Microsoft
                            introduced a self-hosting service called “Realms” for the game and I was finally able to
                            make that dream become a reality. “Realms” allows players to upload their world file to a
                            Microsoft server so that even if the original owner of the world isn’t online others can
                            play. What this means to me is that I could finally upload my Xbox worlds to the server and
                            download them to PC for the first time ever.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This sounded good an all but all of this stuff was introduced when I didn’t have an Xbox
                            anymore. For the longest time I considered my dream to play my worlds on PC was impossible,
                            and when I stopped using my Xbox I got rid of it. I was distraught but at the beginning of
                            this year I let one of my best friends log into my account on his Xbox and he uploaded the
                            files one-by-one to the server; I downloaded them; and saw old worlds I haven’t played since
                            2011 and 2012 for the first time in years. It was honestly an emotional moment since some of
                            the worlds were made before I even met some of my best friends I still have today. I was
                            ecstatic and made sure to back them up on my computer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Normally that’s be the end of it but my plan after I recovered the files was to make a
                            server with a mod that allows multiple worlds to be loaded at once and allows players to
                            teleport to whatever world they want to play on. The problem being is that all my worlds are
                            from the “Bedrock” edition of Minecraft and what I wanted to do was only possible on the
                            “Java” version (these versions are <b>not</b> compatible).
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t4-2">Converting Worlds</h3>
                        <p>
                            What this meant was that I had to find a tool that converted my old worlds to Java ones.
                            Luckily for 80% of them all of them worked without issue, but the last 20% had some issues.
                            In some worlds, creatures like people’s pets were missing, items were missing, and some
                            parts of the worlds loaded incorrectly. So my goal I started this year was to add back in
                            the pets (by comparing the normal “Bedrock” version to the “Java” version), adding back in
                            missing item, and adjusting the conversion tool’s parameters to fixing missing parts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Currently I’m at a point where 99% of it is done and I have a server my friends can join at
                            any time and go though memory lane to look at the several worlds we played with growing up;
                            all in one central place. The last 1% of what I want to do is add protection to each worlds
                            so people can’t break blocks and/or take items from the worlds (removing the preservation
                            aspect of the world). I doubt my friends would do that since they also want to preserve, but
                            it’s a safety precaution regardless.
