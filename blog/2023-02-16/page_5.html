                        <h2 id="t5">Medical Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            Other than the entertainment side of things I wanted to address, my health is something I am
                            looking more into maintaining now. Although I’m skinny I’m not the healthiest of a person,
                            add to the fact I’m mostly sedentary and it’s not a great health choice. So some small goals
                            this year I wanted to address was my dental and physical health.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t5-1">Dental Work</h3>
                        <p>
                            The “easiest” one to do is get my wisdom teeth removed, luckily I only have 2 so it won’t be
                            as expensive as getting 4 our and they’ve crowned already so removing them should be an
                            easier job than if they were still under my skin. Recently I got a referral from my normal
                            dentist to visit an Oral Surgeon and am in the working phase of getting that started. Once
                            done I’ll be done with major dental work and I’ll keep up my pace of keeping my teeth in
                            good health. Since in the past I’ve had horrible dental history, and doing this last thing
                            will be a burden off my mind.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t5-2">Physical and Mental Health</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was isn’t as concrete as my other goals but something I want to look at regardless.
                            Like I said I’m a sedentary person and I don’t want that to be a factor in preventable harm
                            to my body. So I plan to go see my doctor for a general health checkup. Normally this is
                            easy, just make an appointment, get some blood work done, and get a report back. However for
                            someone like me who has had a long past of passing out even being in a medical environment
                            (besides Dental) this is no easy task. So currently my plan is to see my therapist and try
                            to create a plan in how to manage my phobia of blood and/or medical environments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To make a long story short I never had a history of passing out or phobia of blood but one
                            day in high school when learning about hemophilia I felt like I was getting tired and passed
                            out. Ever since then, whenever I read, see, or hear anything about biology, organs, or am in
                            a medical environment I get a pressure on the back of my head and start to lose my vision.
                            Sometimes I can handle it but others I pass out. Even more confusing to me is that
                            consciously I know I’m passing out and want myself to stop, but my subconscious seems to
                            take over and make me collapse.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is the only major actual roadblock so far on my list that effects my life in a negative
                            way and is something I’ve wanted to address for a long time. So if I can learn coping
                            mechanisms for this I’d be a much happier person.
                        </p>
