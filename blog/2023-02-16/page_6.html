                        <h2 id="t6">Mt. Olympus of Language Learning</h2>
                        <p>
                            As I’ve <a href="../2022-05-28/page_3.html">written about in the past</a> my goal for a
                            long time has been to move to Japan and work there. I’ve made progress over time but
                            looking back to even 2022 I’m disappointed in my overall progress. I’m still glad with
                            what work I put in the last few years but now that I’ve been self studying for almost
                            2-3 years now I have seemed to found out my preferred method of learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For months I tried doing what everything online says to do when learning a language:
                            “immerse in content you like”, “try doing things in everyday life in your target language”,
                            and etc. I looked at all of the advice you could find and nothing was working. The problem
                            was that things that I used to enjoy about Japanese were destroyed by me learning the
                            language. What I mean is that before I started learning the language it was something
                            unknown and interesting to me, and was fascinating to think about learning. But the more I
                            learned the less I started to understand. The phrase “the more you learn, the more you
                            realize you don’t know” started to apply.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To summarize I tried to do things I like but in Japanese but kept falling back to flash-card
                            decks since everything else was above my understanding / comprehension level. I tried going
                            to things my level but they were too boring, so I was stuck either being frustrated trying
                            to do things I normally like but not understanding or listen/read children’s content and
                            being bored to death.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However at the beginning of this year it felt like I hit a breakthrough and started to be
                            able to comprehend things I normally like without it being too hard anymore. The problem
                            with Japanese unlike other languages that are based on the roman alphabet (ABC) is that you
                            have to spend time learning the character set before you can even read anything, never-mind
                            understand it. This was the massive hurdle I had to overcome before jumping into content I
                            wanted to initially look at.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t6-1">The Character Sets</h3>
                        <p>
                            For Japanese there are 3 “character sets” to learn:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana"
                                    target="_blank">Hiragana</a>（ひらがな・ヒラガナ・平仮名）</li>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana"
                                    target="_blank">Katakana</a>（かたかな・カタカナ・片仮名）</li>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" target="_blank">Kanji</a>（かんじ・カンジ・漢字）</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first two are easier in that they’re “only” have 46 characters to learn per set,
                            additionally they’re pronounced the same every time since they’re a “syllabary”. Meaning
                            that if you see あ it’s pronounced “ah” every time you see it, not like the letter “a” which
                            can sound different depending on words like: “Cat”, “Car”, and “Ant”. So even if you take
                            your time you can learn how to read them in about a month. The real problem comes with the
                            Kanji (or when translated “Chinese Characters”).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Technically there are over thousands of characters in Japanese, but the main amount you need
                            to know are the “Every Day Kanji” or Jōyō Kanji (常用漢字). What these are, are a set of
                            specific characters that are taught to people in school in Japan (and abroad) and are the
                            common set of characters you see everyday. Like I said there are more characters than this
                            overall in Japanese but you need to know <b>this</b> set to properly understand the
                            language. In
                            total there are 2,136 characters to learn and this was the crux of my understanding for
                            years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Originally back in college I was ahead of the curve in that I started using
                            <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank">Wanikani</a> before
                            our class started to learn Kanji and was always ahead. Even up until graduation I was ahead
                            of what we were learning in that aspect, but Japanese isn’t just the characters. It has
                            words and grammar that clue everything together and that’s what I struggled with. I noticed
                            at the end of college my reading comprehension was a bit bad because I couldn’t understand
                            the words and for 2021 and 2022 I spent most of it burying my head in flashcard programs
                            like Wanikani/Anki learning hundreds of words.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tried every so often to reach out to the textbooks and material I was told to look at
                            (according to sources online) but always feel back to these apps because reading was too
                            hard. I tried learning how to use grammar to get better at reading but could never learn
                            because the examples used words in them I didn’t know, making it impossible to learn.
                            Eventually I accumulated enough words and characters in the language to know be able to make
                            that transition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’m “only” level 34 on Wanikani, meaning I know around 1,131 characters and x3 of that in
                            words and from the other flash card app “Anki” it says I know 3891 words. Some words between
                            the two apps overlap so I consider my “known word count” to be around 5000 words. But
                            nevertheless this was the level I feel like I was now comfortable re-trying that transition
                            out again.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t6-2">Branching Out</h3>
                        <p>
                            At this point I made an effort to open up my old college text book and give it a new read,
                            as well as start studying grammar on a flash card grammar site called
                            <a href="https://bunpro.jp/dashboard" target="_blank">Bunpro</a>.
                            Of which I can directly study grammar points that are in my textbook to get pre-study in
                            before reading passages. So far I learned all the grammar points up to Chapter 5 on the
                            website and I’ve been reading passages from chapter 1 and 2. It feels amazing to actually be
                            able to read and <b>understand</b> what is going on in them. I remember reading these
                            passages in college and having a rough idea of what’s being said and being able to get
                            passing marks on my class. However I never felt like I <b>got</b> what was happening, what
                            the exact tone and emotion was being conveyed. I still struggle with it now but have noticed
                            on subsequent re-readings of passages multiple times that the more I do it the better I get
                            at it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Obviously this isn’t mind-blowing news to anyone who’s learned a language, it’s normal.
                            However for me it’s amazing since I feel like all the effort I put into dragging myself
                            through the onslaught of flash card reviews was now paying off. I know I could of probably
                            did this earlier if I just stuck it out on easier content 2 years ago but I was stubborn. I
                            made a point this year (and the purpose of this post) to get rid of any background noise in
                            my head so that I can 100% put myself in a “Japanese” mode most of the year. The problems
                            when studying over the last couple years was that all of these distractions and things I
                            wanted to do were “getting” in the way of my Japanese. So now that I’m addressing them and
                            fixing them I’ve noticed my Japanese improving faster than I’ve ever noticed.

                        <p>
                            So far my daily regiment has been:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do all my daily Anki reviews (whatever the number of words happens to be)</li>
                            <li>Learn 10 new words a day (minimum) on Anki until I learn all my cards</li>
                            <li>Do all my grammar reviews on BunPro (adding 3 new grammar points per day)</li>
                            <li>Do all my Kanji/Vocab reviews on Wanikani (trying to level up at least twice a month)
                            </li>
                            <li>Read at least one passage from my Textbook</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>I admit some days I don’t even feel like doing one of them, but I’ve noticed that whenever I
                            do all of them I get a great feeling of accomplishment. My end goal for the end of this year
                            like I wrote on my white board is to: </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learn all the words on my Anki program (around 3,000 more)</li>
                            <li>Get to level 50 on Wanikani (so around 80% coverage of the Joyo Kanji)</li>
                            <li>Finish all the N4 grammar points on Bunpro (N3 and N2 being stretch goals)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is a lot to do but I know it’s achievable if I keep up my pace that I’ve been doing for
                            almost 2 months now. I’m currently at 128/176 for N4 grammar in BunPro so I know I’m close
                            there, I went from Level 30 to 34 in the time span of January to almost end of February in
                            Wanikani, and I learned around 200-300 new words already in Anki. So I’m confident in my
                            ability to get my skills up by the end of the year.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t6-3">Final Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’m considering taking the <a href="https://www.jlpt.jp/e/" target="_blank">Language
                                Proficiency Test</a>
                            (<a href="https://www.jlpt.jp/index.html" target="_blank">日本語能力試</a>) on December 3rd at
                            the 2nd highest level (JLPT N2). I don’t think I’ll pass that since even though at Wanikani
                            level 50 I’ll know 98.16% of all the Kanji, that doesn’t mean my grammar/reading
                            comprehension & <b>especially</b> my listening comprehension will be high enough. But, I
                            intend to
                            take it anyways since I’ll know what the testing structure will be like and have a record as
                            to what areas I need to improve on. Plus if I pass it, it’s a nice addition to my resume and
                            a entry way into the Japanese job market. The test doesn’t test for output such as writing
                            and speaking, so I’ll have to practice that eventually on my own since I don’t feel
                            comfortable living in Japan without being able to speak proficiently.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s pretty much all for this post and the section on Japanese. It’s been a long adventure
                            learning Japanese but I feel like now I’m getting to the point where I can really begin my
                            journey into <b>understanding</b> the language. Some days I loathed learning it but always
                            knew in
                            the back of my mind it’s something I’ve wanted to do. One day I plan to even take the

                            (日本漢字能力検定) but that’s <b>years</b> (possibly a decade) down the line and only is indicative
                            of writing. I always tell one of my friends I want my Japanese to be on par or better than
                            my English, since I want to be really good at one thing in my life and I chose Japanese to
                            be that thing.

                            Now that I’ve been solving these issues, I can start to go full power into my language
                            studies now! Well that’s all for me, sorry about the long read! じゃ以上で、長い読むことが書いてすみません。

                            多分、いつか日本語だけのポーストが書いています。あの日いいかなと思いますね〜〜〜
