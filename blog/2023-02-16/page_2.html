                        <h2 id="t1">Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            Ever since I moved out here to Arizona I’ve had a few things in the back of my mind I wanted
                            to do but haven’t got around to due to laziness, lack of motivation, and being disorganized.
                            I treat 2021 as a missed out year in terms of goal achieving since it was the year I
                            graduated college, moved across the country away from family & friends, and where I had to
                            work on my mental health for the better part of a year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I know it wasn’t a year that I did a lot but in a way I’m glad I went through since even
                            though I didn’t achieve any life goals I learned a lot. Dealing with depression helped me
                            manage myself and how to control my own emotions better (especially anxiety), living on my
                            own made me more proactive in doing things I found uncomfortable (such as doing
                            medical/government processes without help), and other such activities. I guess in a way it’s
                            a “trial by fire” approach to growing up, but somehow someway I got through it without
                            becoming a mess.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Would I recommend people to move across the country alone, especially people who easily get
                            anxiety? No, not in a million years however I’ll admit it does push someone like me who’s
                            risk-averse & anxious out of their comfort zone. It also gets them to do things that they
                            would normally rely on others to do for them, for themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Continuing, I got a whiteboard in 2021 and started to write my ideas on it to help organize
                            myself better. Initially it was small things such as groceries, debt, and other of small
                            things. In 2022 I decided to put long-term goals on there and see how it would go, a “New
                            Years Resolution” style of goals. Statically most people fail their resolutions so I made
                            sure the goals be something hard but not out of reach, so like “get to level 30 in <a
                                href="../2022-02-07/page.html">Wanikani</a>” (I was level 16 at the time) and “save up X
                            amount of money by December”. Things that would take a while but aren’t like “get fluent in
                            Japanese by 2023” or anything non-descriptive or non-concise.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It worked and at the start of this year I decided to flesh out my white board with more
                            descriptive achievable goals such as:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Finish organizing my media collection</li>
                            <li>Fix and preserve my old Minecraft worlds</li>
                            <li>Get to Level 50 of <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank">Wanikani</a></li>
                            <li>Finish N4 in <a href="https://bunpro.jp/dashboard" target="_blank">Bunpro</a> (N3->N2
                                Stretch Goals)</li>
                            <li>Memorize all words in <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>
                                (around 8,000 / already know 4000)</li>
                            <li>Start Reading <a href="https://tobiraweb.9640.jp/" target="_blank">Tobira</a> (and
                                finish) by mid-year</li>
                            <li>Get Wisdom Teeth Removed</li>
                            <li>Get Checkup at Doctors</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>Although it looks like a lot I’m almost already done with 3 of them already, so I’m already
                            on a good track. However back to the main topic at hand, this whiteboard and it’s goals
                            represent me being more “proactive” in my life and goals. I’ve had all these small and big
                            goals rattling in my head for years (even before I graduated) and I felt like they all got
                            in the way of me being able to be focused. So I decided at the beginning of this year to
                            take action and solve/finish all the small things taking up my attention.</p>

                        <h2 id="t2">Clearing My Head</h2>

                        <p>
                            My primary goal ever since graduating is to move to Japan and work/live there, however I
                            need to actually <b>know</b> and <b>use</b> Japanese to do so. Doing so isn’t an easy task
                            and taking a
                            look at some numbers from the US Department of State’s “Foreign Language Training”
                            <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" target="_blank">chart</a>,
                            Japanese is listed amongst the “Super Hard Languages” that take around 2200 hours to learn
                            to conversational and/or understandable levels. Meaning that it’s not just something I can
                            just hunker down for a year and just do, especially with a full-time job and errands to do.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I knew from the get-go that I need to be focused on learning Japanese and not be
                            distracted when doing so. I need to put in the time and effort if I want to learn Japanese
                            to an acceptable level before moving to Japan. If I kept up the pace I was going at in 2021
                            and 2022 I’d be in the US for another 5-10 years before even consider going. At the
                            beginning of 2023 I decided to add my media collections, medical procedures, and misc items
                            to the white board on-top of my Japanese to check-off. I wanted to focus on just my Japanese
                            and have no noise in the background in my head distracting me from my studies. So I went
                            after the smaller achievable goals first, my media collection being one of them.
