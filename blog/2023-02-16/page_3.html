                        <h2 id="t3">Organizing My Media</h2>
                        <p>
                            What I mean by “organizing” my media collection is that I have an assortment of: Blu-rays,
                            CDs, and other media on my devices that I keep for entertainment. However they’re either
                            incomplete (songs without lyrics, artists, etc), too big (some 4K movies are 88GBs big), or
                            unfound (obscure Japanese songs I can’t find the source to). So the goal there is to
                            organize that data so that it’s in a place where I feel like it’s “finished” and organized.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t3-1">Music</h3>
                        <p>
                            I guess a more concrete example of what I mean by organizing for example (that pertains to
                            music) would be my old YouTube playlist backup. So back in 2014 or so I used to use YouTube
                            for my music collection but noticed over time videos would get taken down. In 2017 I used a
                            tool to convert all the videos to mp3 files and saved them to my phone as a backup so I’d
                            never lose the songs. For a time this was fine, however as I got into CDs more over time I
                            noticed how much better the CD quality sounded over YouTube videos.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was because most YouTube videos (seem to) cap audio at 128kbps mp3 quality and CDs are
                            uncompressed audio. In layman’s terminology, it’s like listening to someone talk on the
                            phone vs in person (not as bad as a phone, but not too far off). Once I heard how much of a
                            massive difference CD sounded over the YouTube songs I started an adventure in college to
                            find the sources of my YouTube playlists over time. For more popular music like: The
                            Beatles, Metallica, and the like it was easy; just type in the artist and album and buy the
                            CD.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, since all my backups were from YouTube all I had to go off of was the title of the
                            video. Meaning if I wanted to find some obscure Japanese song or anime soundtrack and the
                            video title didn’t have all the information there, I’d have no where to do. Doubly so if the
                            original video was deleted and no alternative was uploaded. Triply (is that word?) so, since
                            back then I didn’t know any Japanese so looking up obscure media was a shot in the dark.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What ended up happening was, I bought all the music I could find at stores, online, etc for
                            as many songs as I could (I had like 3000 songs between all my playlists) and keeping the
                            remaining unfound media as 128kbps mp3 files on my computer laying remnant. Over the years I
                            slowly chipped away at some songs, but some seemed impossible to find; until at the
                            beginning of this year I seemed to have made a breakthrough. Now that I crammed thousands of
                            Japanese words into my head over the years the previously obscure media that I couldn’t find
                            the sources to, I was now able to. I bought and imported music over the last couple weeks
                            and have gotten it down my YouTube collection to 10 unknown songs (9 which have names but I
                            can’t find a CD quality version anywhere but 1 with a name I can’t seem to match anywhere,
                            it’s literally called “Touhou Song”).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While I search for those I also have been adding lyrics to every song in my collection
                            (13,330 according to my phone; at least 40% are instrumentals), converting the meta-data on
                            my Japanese albums to contain the Japanese original names and artists, and overall cleaning
                            up everything. So instead of say a song being: “Hikouki Gumo by Yumi Arai” it says “ひこうき雲 –
                            荒井由実. Although it seems pointless (and truthfully it kind of is) I noticed over time it
                            really helps me reinforce words I’ve learned over time. Especially when adding lyrics since
                            there’s been a couple times where I had to transcribe lyrics and it gave me some listening
                            practice.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t3-2">TV and Movies</h3>
                        <p>
                            For this collection I don’t have much of a story like I do with my music, but still it’s
                            something that bothered me for a bit so I decided to tackle it. Currently my TV shows are
                            90% English so organizing them isn’t too bad, however some of the anime I have is from US/UK
                            releases so I had to do some work on them to get them “organized” to my liking.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I changed the names of each episode to the original Japanese ones and use what’s called an
                            “OCR” or “Optical Character Recognition” program on the subtitles. On Blu-rays, subtitles
                            are bitmap image files and the OCR takes those images and tries to figure out a text
                            equivalent character of said file. When it’s done running I can use the extracted text (as
                            .srt files) and add them back to the movie file. I did this since some devices don’t support
                            certain subtitle files but support “srt” ones universally.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Additionally since some audio types are not supported on all devices (mainly my phone and
                            tablet) such as Dolby Digital 7.1 audio, I use a combination of software (mainly ffmpeg) to
                            convert the audio to FLAC files (which all devices can read) and recombine the audio back
                            into the TV/movie file. I mainly do this for movies since most TV shows aren’t using
                            surround sound, so it’s not as a monumental task as it seems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As for movies I noticed that all my 4K HDR movies seemed to be around 60-80 GBs per movie
                            and wanted to reduce those sizes for my portable devices. What I used to do when I traveled
                            was copy 1-2 movies to my phone’s SD card and hope that’d be enough. However I got
                            frustrated (especially doing long flights/days) since I’d run out of things to watch. So I
                            thought of re-encoding videos to get smaller versions for my phone, but with HDR movies I
                            noticed that the encoding would be off and never worked so I put it off.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, recently with the AV1 encoder being more well supported now I’ve been able to
                            reduce file sizes significantly. A 80GB movie could be compressed down to 8-12GBs with
                            proper color mapping. Additionally, even when I try pixel peeping on my TV I couldn’t tell a
                            difference between the source and compressed version. So I started to use my computer to run
                            a few hours a day to get my movie collection down to a small enough size to put all on my
                            small devices.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t3-3">Concluding Thoughts on Media Organization</h3>
                        <p>
                            All of this is very unneeded and over the top, but I guess at some point I deemed it
                            necessary for the sake of convenience (especially when traveling in terms of my movies).
                            Also, since it was in the back of my head I deemed it necessary to figure out. I’m just glad
                            I decided to take on this endeavor now instead of leaving it since I know in the back of my
                            mind there was still old songs I haven’t listened to in years I wanted to find the sources
                            of and wanted to put more media on my mobile devices without swapping SD cards.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Also at this point with how many hours I have put into researching, editing, and organizing
                            my media (especially music) collection it’s kind of become apart of personal journey for me.
                            It’s not just songs I like but a “thing” that I emotionally tie to parts of my life.
                            Especially songs that I first listened to years ago and then found the sources to. Going
                            from YouTube quality to full surround in some songs (especially obscure anime songs) was an
                            emotional experience.
