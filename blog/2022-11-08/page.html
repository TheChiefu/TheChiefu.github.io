                        <p>
                            I’m surprised I didn’t forget about this site for over a year like I normally do when I make
                            these, but here I am 5 months from my last post (if we’re not counting the Japan influence
                            post). I’m sure if I really dug I could say a lot of things have changed but nothing major.
                            I’m still doing more or less the same work, doing the same routines, and talking to the same
                            people. But my mindset over time has shifted towards a more positive attitude since my last
                            post. I know last time I talked about my dreams, doubts, and depression but this time I’m
                            flipping it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To get the good news out of the way I’ll start with the fact that I booked a ticket to Japan
                            sometime around November. To most that’d be a cool trip to a foreign country but to me it’s
                            much more than that. Japan despite having its mountain of social and historical issues is a
                            place that holds a lot of meaning to me. I don’t think I’d be in the place I’m in without
                            the influence of that country. Nintendo, Sony, Toei Animation, and a plethora of other
                            companies originate from there and shape the person I am today. I always tell my friends
                            that half of me is comprised of American (or to a larger extent Western) culture and the
                            other half Japanese culture; not in a worshiping kind of way however like
                            <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/weeaboo">Weeaboos</a> or
                            <a href="https://imgur.com/4FjiGcJ">Rawhide Kobayashi</a> but in appreciation of both cultures and mindsets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want more detailed explanation in why I refer to my personality as Half Western Half
                            Eastern, check out my post about it here for an excruciatingly long post about Japan’s
                            influence on me (the first two pages are the gist, the rest is more or less me gushing about
                            my hobbies and interests). But if you don’t want to read the entire thing I’ll tell you the
                            short version. Essentially most of my life Japan’s culture has had a way of seeping its way
                            into my life in most places: video games, movies, TV, you name it. Although I grew up in
                            America I’m not very “American” in the sense that I’m not patriotic, individualist, or the
                            like; so I always felt for the lack of a better term “un-American”. I always found the
                            collectivist Japanese society and their media as the other half of me and find that aspect
                            of their culture apart of me.
                        </p>

                            However this post isn’t about my half/half feelings, we’re here to talk about an update on
                            my life as it is now! So like I said before I’ll be traveling by mid-end of November and
                            currently my mood is surprisingly calm. I say surprisingly because you’d think for someone
                            who’s been wanting to go since they were 10 and has gotten to so close to going but never
                            has would be more excited. Yet, for some reason I am not super excited nor anxious.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Many attempts to travel</h2>

                        <p>
                            The first opportunity I almost got to go was in 2020 when I applied for a scholarship to
                            travel abroad late 2019 and got approved after numerous papers, documentation, and the like.
                            Back then I was super excited to go since I always wanted to go and thought summer of 2020
                            was a great time to do. However not knowing the situation of covid at the time little did I
                            know 2020 was not the time I’d be going. I was disappointed at first but assured myself that
                            even if covid wasn’t spreading like wildfire, 2020 was not the best time to go. At that time
                            I just did Japanese 101 and 102 and knew next to nothing, so language ability wise it would
                            of been abysmal and probably turned me sour to Japan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then thought, “okay once I graduate college I’ll go, covid should be gone by then right?….
                            right!?”. Yeah I was wrong on that, even though it was mid 2021 at the time Japan still was
                            closed off and covid still lingering around the US at the time. Although my Japanese was
                            better having gone through what was 3 years of Japanese in college done in 2 years (I did 2
                            summer courses to makeup for a year), it still wasn’t great. My reading skills were low, the
                            grammar awful, and still overall pretty bad.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally I thought I thought, “I’ll just go in 2022, surely everything will be back to
                            normal”. Well I was right in that the rest of the world was open for tourism, but Japan
                            being Japan was still closed off despite every other major country being open. In regards to
                            my Japanese it was a lot better than before since I dove deep into studying Kanji and
                            Vocabulary hard so I wasn’t a complete dunce in my reading ability. I still struggle
                            grammatically however, but I’m far better off than I was a year ago. I could actually read
                            most characters and text without looking things up now rather than being lost every other
                            kanji.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I almost pushed my plans back to 2023 but my friends who are still in University and in
                            Japan for study told me that open tourism was opening up in October and pretty much
                            immediately after they told me I booked a trip in November as fast as I could.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Plans</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once I got the email it felt weird knowing that I’d be traveling to this place I’ve been
                            wanting to go to for so long. At first it didn’t feel real since in my mind Japan is just a
                            place I’ve pictured in my head for so long. I’m not expecting to get there and be blown away
                            by anything. It’s the same feeling I felt hearing Japanese in person for the first time in
                            University, a bit surprising at first since I’ve only heard it in media and not in person
                            but normalized pretty quickly. That’s my assumption in what’s going to happen when I get
                            there, a bit of “wow I’m actually here” and then “okay, now what?”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I am describing this trip as this big “coming of age” journey finally going to this
                            “fantasy land”, it’s not really much. Really the only thing I plan to do it go to
                            Tashirojima (田代島) or “Cat Island”, and leave everything up to me when I’m there. The main
                            reason I’m doing that is so that I at least have one goal to plan for and not feel
                            overwhelmed with a need that to check off everything on a pre-planned list. I know from
                            experience having been to New York City with family numerous times that doing a million
                            things at certain times because that was apart of the plan is mostly just stress. Since
                            nothing is worse than running around trying to be at multiple places on time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other than visiting the land of the cats, I’m not planning on doing too much which is great
                            for me. I bought a Fujifilm GFX 50SII for this trip (well and other reasons, not just this
                            <b>one</b> trip) and plan to use it to get really good photos I can share with friends and family,
                            as well as for myself when I look back at my first trip. Nothing is better than looking at
                            crisp high quality images rather than blurry phone photos (I’m a bit of a pixel peeper).
                            Other than that I plan to bring my 360 camera to get a couple of cool shots as well as my
                            favorite plush; Rei Plush.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I know that last part is a bit out of nowhere but to make a long story short, the plush
                            is a joke on the internet. The joke it’s is based on a very serious character from a show
                            being used in pictures in a very over the top or unusual situations. Here are just a few
                            examples:

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            So that leaves me today 10 days out from my trip to Japan. Am I excited? In some ways yes
                            but overall no, I want to go but I don’t have any expectations. I want the trip to be
                            spontaneous and fun, not planned and stressful. I feel like I’ll be excited when I finally
                            take my steps of the plane and am actually there, who knows maybe I got scammed or the
                            flights get canceled and I don’t get to go. Wouldn’t be the first time I nearly got to go to
                            Japan before something happened. So better to stay calm and collected than all excited then
                            disappointed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m almost 100% certain though the day I wake up to go to the airport I’ll be in 100% stress
                            mode until I take a step on that plane. I’m better at managing my anxiety now but nothing is
                            more stressful than paying $1000+ for a flight and missing it. So I guess the stress is
                            warranted in some way. Here hope for a smooth trip!
