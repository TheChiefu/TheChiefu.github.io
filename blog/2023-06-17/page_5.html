                        <p>
                            I woke up the next morning, still not hungry (maybe because of the Jet-lag / stress) and got
                            up early to make my trek from 千葉 [Chiba]. I got to Tokyo station and was going to take the
                            bullet train directly to the city so I had time to mess around before seeing my teachers in
                            the afternoon. However my train pass only covered the 東北地方 [Touhoku Region] and they are in
                            central Japan. So instead of forking out the $100 or so ticket I decided to take the normal
                            commuter train. It was fun at first since I got to pass through the towns that the faster
                            trains skip over. I saw all walks of life from city to rural people, elementary school
                            commuters to seniors. However the fun of riding on the same train for 6 hours got tiring
                            after a while. I still got to the correct station despite taking the slower train (hooray
                            for my habit of leaving early to everything I guess). I met up with 愛子先生(Akio-sensei) at the
                            station and then to the car in which both her and 福永先生(Fukunaga-sensei) brought me to their
                            apartment. I tried to keep conversation in my broken Japanese until we settled back into
                            English. They made dinner and I was able to catch up on their life after moving from RI back
                            to Japan.

                            I ate as much of the food as I could despite already feeling full to try to respect the
                            effort put into it. I loved the food, but felt bad that I wasn’t able to eat my portions.
                            However I had a great conversation with them and promptly went to bed as I could barely keep
                            my eyes open. It felt a bit odd sleeping over my teacher’s house but I was too tired to
                            really care. The next morning I took a shower and we went out to different spots around 浜松
                            [Hamamatsu]. The first was to my teacher’s university (I unfortunately didn’t get a picture
                            on top of the roof), then to a museum talking about the city’s history and flag competition,
                            then to the sand dunes on the beach, a flower park, and finally a cafe/restaurant to each
                            lunch.

                            At the time I felt bad for being quiet and not interacting much with them considering how
                            little time they had to have me over. It was just that during the time I was there I’d only
                            been in Japan 2 days and was overwhelmed with everything and felt depressive symptoms of not
                            being able to enjoy things. I felt familiar feelings of dread when they were taking me back
                            to the train station as I did when my family back home would take me back to the airport. I
                            guess I’m just bad at goodbyes. In retrospective however I’m glad I took the opportunity I
                            did to see them again. Even if in the moment I wasn’t really able to relish in it.

                            Around noon I was taken back to the train station and made my 6 hour train ride back to my
                            hotel. Trying furiously to get a picture of 富士山 [Mt. Fuji] but was not successful. However
                            being on the trains so long in my short time in Japan did make me understand Train Otakus
                            (people who obsess over trains) more though. For some reason it’s relaxing being on a train
                            and just watching the sights pass by. Especially when going by farming villages and mountain
                            passes.

                            I got back to my hotel in the late evening and just enjoyed being back at “home base” where
                            I could relax. I had the TV on and watched a few interesting shows about random people
                            playing piano in a public park, cave divers, and a little bit of the world cup. I soaked in
                            the bath and watched the TV through the door. The next day I didn’t have much planned since
                            I was going to the cat island the day after. So I pretty much just relaxed and walked around
                            the area near my hotel to re-energize before my next big trip.
