                        <p>
                            The next day I went to the closest mall and wandered around hoping to find a shoe store
                            since my shoes were completely worn down at this point. They stunk like crazy, were damp
                            even a day later, and were extremely dirty. However it took a few hours of hunting since
                            every couple steps my feet were aching from the (unknown to me at the time) blisters on my
                            feet. I eventually bought new shoes and just found the nearest trash can and dumped my old
                            ones. On my way back I stopped by a McDonald’s and tried out the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich,
                            which was what I needed at the time since I could take all the comfort foods that I could
                            get.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I spent a day mostly relaxing after the cat island trip and getting new shoes since I felt
                            so exhausted. I also didn’t want to damage my feet any further by walking around more. The
                            next day came and it was the last day I had before I went to the airport, so I made the
                            adventure back to Akihabara to make sure I scouted everything there to get for friends and
                            family, and made a good haul. I found a crane game that had plushies from a YouTube channel
                            my friend and I like watching called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@purinharumaki_karameru">からめる</a>. As well as a few Kirby ones, vtuber keychains
                            for myself, and other knickknacks. I was tempted to buy some NieR soundtracks but held
                            myself back because of the price, but still thought it was cool to hold them in my hands
                            physically.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The night before I left I got all my things together, washed a few of my clothes in the tub, and stuffed everything into the bags as much as I could. The next morning I got up early and took the train back to the airport. Making sure to get there as early as possible to ensure a safe ride home.
