                        <h3 id="t3-1">My First Day in Japan</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once I got up after a miserable sleep, I got out of my stinky 16+ hour flight clothes, took
                            a shower, then a bath. I felt like that one shower alone shed a layer of stress and anxiety
                            away and I had the energy to go out and explore. I had no plan other than seeing the Cat
                            Island so this let me have days like my 1st day in Japan when I could have a mental health
                            day. I got on the train next to my hotel around 9AM and went back to the airport station to
                            pickup my train pass. When I picked it up, they said I was allowed a free one time ride to
                            東京駅 [Tokyo station], so I took it and blindly went into Tokyo.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Initially I didn’t have much of a plan, but I thought that since I’m already in Tokyo I
                            should at least check out 秋葉原 [Akihabara] (a popular game and anime shopping district). It
                            was about at 45 minute walk from the station I was at, so I decided to walk instead of
                            taking a train. The main reason being that I’m already too sedentary as it is and thought
                            the exercise would be good. It also had the added benefit of simulating life in Tokyo, since
                            in the past all the Japan job postings I’d seen online were in Tokyo. So I could use this
                            opportunity to study the city that I’d likely be living in when I move to Japan.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                            </i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I eventually got to 秋葉原 [Akihabara] as the sun was setting and was able to get a couple of
                            good photos of the buildings as the advertising signs lit up the streets. It was hard
                            getting some pictures since there was a wall of people walking on the sidewalk. I try my
                            hardest to not be an intrusive photographer and always point my camera down when not in use,
                            and not point at strangers. So some photos I wanted to take I weren’t able to, but I’d say I
                            got a good set.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I didn’t expect much when I was there since I’m not the biggest anime fan anymore and never
                            have been a collector but picked up a couple CDs to rip and a few gifts to bring back to
                            friends and family. My biggest surprise was going into multiple stores, going up to the 2nd
                            floor, and seeing walls of adult videos. I’d heard of these stores before but never knew
                            where they were until then. I thought it was pretty funny and decided to bring back a photo
                            gallery set of an AV model back for my friend as a gag gift during Christmas (I think he’s
                            still hiding those in shame to this day).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I thought I’d made a successful trip and took the train back to my hotel. On my way back I
                            noticed they seemed to have a lot of Christmas lights and decorations setup. I thought it
                            was interesting and took a couple photos before I went back to my hotel to relax.
