                            Although not a perfect vacation (I don’t recommend sleeping outside in November), I’d say
                            overall it was a fun experience. It was a taste of Japan before moving there and it gave me
                            the learning opportunity on how to navigate the train system, shops, and other skills needed
                            to live there. I know traveling for vacation isn’t the same as moving somewhere but at least
                            I have the know-how of navigation before I take the jump to move.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I already have a flight and hotel booked this year to visit Osaka this year as a (hopefully)
                            final trip before I move there by the end of next year. I plan to visit 姫路城 (Himeji Castle),
                            奈良公園 (Nara Park), and possibly some other locations. I wasn’t able to visit any of my former
                            schoolmates while they were living there abroad but I still like seeing picture from them
                            regardless. On top of that trip I’m already also planning a trip to visit Europe early next
                            year. My reason being is that if I’m moving to Japan by the end of 2024 I might as well take
                            vacation time that I have in my current company to visit somewhere else and not Japan again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My ideal plan would to visit Cairo, Athens, and Rome for a historical journey around Europe.
                            But it’s not concrete yet and it’s still an idea rattling in my head. I do want to visit
                            every continent at least once in my life. But that’s all for me, I hope to have a fun 2nd
                            trip and improve my Japanese over the course of the year!
                        </p>
