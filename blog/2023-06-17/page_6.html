                        <p>
                            I got a good (enough) sleep and woke up the next morning around 8-9AM to take the trip up to
                            仙台 (Sendai). Luckily this trip was apart of my train pass and I was able to navigate my way
                            through the train stations and take the 新幹線 (Bullet Train) from 東京 (Tokyo) in about 2 hours.
                            I got my 2nd to last destination and had to take a 2nd line to the port city 石巻
                            (Ishinomaki). Interestingly as I saw my train pull up I saw it was covered in a manga wrap,
                            which is apparently made in the style of a famous manga artist

                        <p>
                            I got to the city and wandered around for a bit trying to find the port that would bring me
                            to the cat island. Well apparently google maps hadn’t updated the location or GPS data
                            around this town since I was wandering around aimlessly trying to find it until the sun
                            finally set. I was determined (too stubbornly) to find the port so I could figure out the
                            times in which the ship would sail to the island before I went to a hotel to sleep. I
                            finally found it at like 10PM after wandering the city like a creep and by that point it was
                            past check in times for hotels. So I (stupidly) thought that because the weather had been
                            warm enough (I took my of coat for most of the day) that I’d just sleep at the park. Well it
                            was fine at first but as the hours ticked on it got colder, and colder, and colder!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It went from being around 25C throughout the day to a freezing 3-4C. Since it’s a port city,
                            cold ocean winds would blow over the seawall and into the bowl that was the park. I ended up
                            curled in a ball next to the locked bathroom door, since it had three walls to keep the wind
                            away from me and only one that didn’t. I almost brought my thicker coat that day but decided
                            against it since most of the week was temperate, I regretted that decision heavily.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the night went on I kept getting cat naps of half and hour to an hour until I was able to
                            take the first ship to the island. I had multiple face masks so I used one to cover my eyes
                            from the bright light that was blasting me from above and another to cover my face and keep
                            it warm from the wind. I also shoved my pants into my socks to cut off any openings from
                            windchill. All while hoping that no weird people (like myself) were outside at night and
                            could possibly be dangerous, as a bright light was revealing my location. My other concern
                            as day approached was that I wouldn’t be caught sleeping in the park since I wasn’t sure if
                            it was illegal or not, so as 6AM approached and I saw a single person walking around, I left
                            immediately and moved over to a public apartment waiting room to keep warm. I’d never
                            appreciated the luxuries of HVAC as much as I did that morning waiting for the ship. I got
                            on and even though the trip to cat island was apparently an hour I passed out comfortably
                            inside the cabin.
