                        <p>
                            Originally this year I’d planned to get to level 50 in Wanikani by the end of this year then
                            take the JLPT N2 test in December. The problem being, is that I did not anticipate how much
                            burnout I’d experience so soon in my studies. I should’ve known from experience that going
                            at a fast face would lead to burn out but at the start of the year I was doing 2 levels of
                            Wanikani in a month by rushing 100s of new lessons in a day, studying multiple times a day,
                            and so on. But by the time April came around I had flat-lined completely on Wanikani. To
                            make matters worse when I got my wisdom teeth taken out I was drained of all my energy for
                            weeks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s not to say I didn’t do <b>anything</b> between then and now, just that my Japanese
                            reviews
                            had dropped and am now revising my goals. So from now on instead of chasing level 50 in
                            Wanikani to get 80% JLPT N2 coverage, I’m now aiming for 8,000 words on Anki (already
                            halfway there) and N3 coverage on BunPro, while dropping Wanikani entirely. Although it
                            pains me to do so, I’ve been noticing a trend throughout my studies that Wanikani has a
                            severe flaw that other SRS tools like Anki and BunPro don’t have. It’s called “Burned”
                            items.

                            To quickly summarize, “Burned” items are items you’ve seen multiple times and got correct
                            for at least 6 months. The assumption made is that if you got it correct that many times you
                            “should know it by now”. This assumption according to multiple posts on the Wanikani forums
                            by the creator himself is that you should already be consuming Japanese content and already
                            be seeing the words you’ve encountered on the site elsewhere. While it’s a noble assumption,
                            I’m in the “not so lucky” group that doesn’t actively like studying the language. So what
                            ends up happening to me is that I study almost exclusively on Wanikani for months, get a
                            word burned, never see it again and forget it. Meaning that I have a list of words from at
                            least a 1-2 years ago that I haven’t seen and likely already forgot. This is the biggest
                            reason I’m cutting my losses with Wanikani. It’s been a boon in kick-starting my Kanji
                            comprehension and I’ll give credit where it’s due, but I feel like I’ve fallen outside the
                            tool’s useful group.

                                An example of a word I burned back in 2021 that I didn’t know today. This would of been
                                sent back as a “new” word in Anki, but if I kept up with Wanikani I’d never see it
                                again.

                            This is where my continuation of Anki and BunPro come into the picture. With those SRS apps
                            they’ll show words from any time period. I’ve come across words I haven’t seen in a year or
                            two, and if I forgot it I can simply press “forgot” and it pushes the review into the
                            “relearning” phase. Where in which it shows me the word frequently until I build up the
                            correct percentage again. This is great for someone like me who doesn’t do (really any)
                            consumption of Japanese content outside a few niche areas since the tool doesn’t assume I
                            “just know it”. I’ve often had periods where I’m relearning a couple old cards and getting
                            it wrong helps me remember it better because now it sticks out. Plus I was doing a lot of
                            “double reviewing” in that words from Anki and Wanikani overlapped. So now I can save time
                            by just doing one. BunPro on the other hand is purely grammar, so I can use words I learned
                            in Anki on that site. Which lets me synergize between the two tools.

                            To wrap my Japanese goals up, I’ve been planning on studying the rest of my Anki cards to
                            completion. Progressing through grammar reviews on BunPro (adding any unknown words from
                            there to anki) until I do the N3 tier. As well as start playing games in Japanese (I’ve been
                            playing the new Zelda game in Japanese) to build up the connections between what I’m
                            studying and content I’m consuming. Who knows, once I get my number of daily Anki reviews to
                            a low enough number (10s) I might come back to finish off Wanikani (since I did pay for a
                            lifetime subscription back in 2019).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ve also been seriously looking into getting a tutor for speaking and listening practice
                            since I get <b>zero</b> of that personally. Also since I’m planning of moving to Japan end of next
                            year I need to build up that skill now rather than later. Speaking of Japan, I already
                            booked a flight this year to visit again and haven’t told of my first trip to Japan that I
                            did last year.
