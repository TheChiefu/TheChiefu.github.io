                            I know last year I wrote about going to Japan before I went, and the first post of this year
                            I was writing about other issues, but I never actually covered my first trip to Japan. I
                            first visited Japan during Thanksgiving break and landed on a Friday afternoon after an
                            agonizing 16 hour flight over Alaska, Canada, and the top of Japan. My first view of Japan
                            felt very postcard-like in that I saw “the land of the rising sun” through the iconic red
                            sun as it was setting.

                            Although exciting at first, the trip to my hotel room before I could relax and unwind was
                            anything but. I was already tired from barely getting any sleep on the plane, then had to
                            figure out all the paperwork for customs all while dragging a suitcase and heavy backpack. I
                            didn’t even bother to pickup my train pass until the day after since I just wanted to lay on
                            my hotel bed. I originally got on the wrong train and flew way past my hotel, finally after
                            several hours of being confused I ended up at the hotel entrance around 9:30PM. Already
                            feeling tried and defeated I check in and the attendant in full speed Keigo (formal)
                            Japanese starts asking my questions. Me being half awake just say “yes” to half the things
                            to get my key-card and go to my room. I was so tired that I didn’t even figure out how to
                            turn on the lights (apparently you need to put the keycard in a holder behind the door for
                            everything to turn on) and just flopped into bed.

                            It wasn’t great sleep since it was one of what I call “stress sleeps”. Where even if you’re
                            physically tired and can’t keep your eyes open, you just can’t fall into REM sleep. Just
                            small bursts of naps until you eventually pass out. It very much reminded me of when I first
                            moved to Arizona. My stomach ached, I wasn’t hungry, and was on the verge of tears. I woke
                            up feeling horrible and for the first couple of days I had to force myself to eat and get
                            out of the hotel since I wasn’t spending $2,000 on a trip and staying in a hotel.
