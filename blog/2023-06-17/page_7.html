                        <p>
                            As I got off the ship to get on the island I noticed rain coming in, it was concerning but
                            wanted to enjoy the trip as much as I could either way and moved on. For some reason I felt
                            like I got the best sleep of my life after I got off the ship and explored as much as the
                            island as I could in the short time I had available. I saw my first cat looking at me
                            concerned from a dilapidated building and I made my trek on the mountainous island. I came
                            across a cafe where souvenirs were sold and bought a couple things for my family, as well as
                            a big udon soup meal for myself. I saw what seemed to be a group of student photographers on
                            the island as I wandered around, but they seemed to mainly stick to the paved roads.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I saw many dirt paths and took the long routes though them in the overgrown forest. I found
                            interesting shrines and got to (brokenly) read the history about what they used the island
                            for. Apparently it was a religious site where people used to mediate. I saw fishing ships
                            off in the distance and a wall of water that hit the side of the island. At one point when I
                            went to sit down a wild cat came out of nowhere and jumped on my lap. It sat there purring
                            and I felt bad leaving it, but knew I couldn’t stay there forever even if I wanted.

                            <i>田代島 (Tashirojima / Cat Island) [2022-11-22]</i>
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Although it was on and off drizzling and down-pouring I still overall enjoyed the trip to
                            the island. What did suck was the shoes I decided to bring with me were my old shoes I had
                            since high school. Even before I set foot in Japan they were already starting to tear along
                            the seams but it didn’t seem like a problem at first. That was until I spent 2 hours in the
                            rain with soaked socks and kilometers of trails trekked. I personally didn’t feel tired but
                            my feet felt disgusting, the ride back to the port town, bullet train back to Tokyo, and
                            finally the normal train back to my hotel felt terrible. I ripped of my soaked shoes and
                            took a long bath.
