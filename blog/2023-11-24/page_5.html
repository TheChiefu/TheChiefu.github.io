                        <p>
                            Even though I’m still doing the photos (which is taking up all my time), I’ve been trying to
                            figure out where I want to go in life. I still have an interest in Japanese and working in
                            Japan but have had many roadblocks in the way. I’ve noticed that the software dev market
                            hasn’t been the kindest even in the US so obviously Japanese companies are a far-cry from
                            reach for me. When I moved back my plan was to work in the US for a year or two and move to
                            Japan; a plan in which I’m still considering.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ve also considered going back to URI while I work either from home or locally to finish
                            off my Japanese degree since I only need 2 classes to get it; and maybe a masters in
                            computer science to help with higher level jobs in the field. However I’ve also had other
                            ideas brewing too.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My main trouble with finding Japanese jobs is two-fold. I lack programming work experience
                            (ie. number of years) and Japanese communication ability. Obviously to work in Japan you
                            need Japanese, so ever since college I’ve been studying it to get better. The problem I’ve
                            been having is that ever since I graduated I suck at keeping myself accountable to pushing
                            myself in it. Sure I can grind vocab and grammar all-day long for years on apps but those
                            don’t help me in communicating or listening.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I realized that I need something or someone to push me hard in learning the language after
                            bombing a talk with a Japanese tech recruiter. So I’ve been considering taking a 10-week
                            high intensity course in Japan to get myself into the mindset of learning, since I am
                            incredibly lazy with self-teaching. The problem with that is the only available class
                            periods <b>start</b> in July of 2024. Meaning I’d be unemployed at least until September of 2024
                            before I even find jobs, which is very scary to me; and puts me off of the idea.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then revert to my old plan and want to work in the US for a bit until I get better. I then
                            think back on how in the last 2 and a half years in Arizona I barely made any real progress
                            in Japanese. Causing my fear to come back and push me towards wanting to take the Japanese
                            courses. Leaving me in the cyclical stressful position of having to find out what I want for
                            myself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ve even asked the question of “why do I want to go to Japan”? I know I’ll get paid less
                            there, I’ll have to struggle to learn Japanese which I don’t like studying, and move away
                            from family. The only reason I can give is “I wanted to since I was a kid” and I’m starting
                            to feel like that’s not enough. The drive at this point is that if I never try it it’ll
                            linger in my head forever, always regretting not trying. At least if I make it there,
                            realize I hate it, and move back; I’ll never have that regret ever again. So I push forwards
                            regardless, even if it’s pure stubbornness pushing me forwards.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Either way… so many choices. I only know in due time how it’ll all come out.
                        </p>
