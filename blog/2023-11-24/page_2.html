                            Nothing much in my life was drastically different around this point. I was getting into more
                            Japanese listening practice, getting some JLPT prep books, and ordering some stuff to send
                            back to RI. Mostly gaming peripherals and such so that when I visited for a week or two I’d
                            have a similar setup to my AZ one. Around this time I planned to visit Peru for an extended
                            weekend and Mexico for another one since I had a new goal of visiting every continent at
                            some point in my life.

                        <h3 id="t1-1">Peru Trip (July 2023)</h3>

                        <p>
                            In July I made the trek out to Peru and landed in Cusco after an agonizing 14 hour flight,
                            multi-hour layover in LA Airport and changing gate numbers. After more than 24 hours of
                            being awake, I stood outside the Cusco airport waiting for my taxi. I was greeted by what
                            looked like some lady and her kid asking me if I was the person they were assigned then took
                            a quick ride from the Airport to my hotel. I knew going in it was going to be sketchy since
                            Peru isn’t the most well off economically, but I used the few Spanish words I knew to thank
                            the driver and check myself in. The hotel itself was okay, but I usually don’t care about
                            accommodations, as long as I had hot water to shower in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Shortly after checking in I got in and readied myself for a shower. I saw a big brick
                            missing from the bathroom wall, and just took a shower since I was too tired to care. It was
                            only like 3PM local time but I was tired and pretty much slept until like 8PM. I booked my
                            hotel next to the train station that’d take me to the town closest to Machu Picchu so that I
                            didn’t have to travel far to the station which was at least relieving.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Around 5:20AM I went to leave my hotel but noticed that everything in the hotel was turned
                            off and locked. The reception had no one there and the front door had a steel door covering
                            it from the outside. At first I was freaking out since I wouldn’t be able to catch my train
                            in time, defeating the entire reason I came to Peru. But luckily a younger man who looks
                            like he helps run the place with his family came out of a backroom to open the door for some
                            of his friends to get in, and I took that time to leave and head off.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I luckily got to the station in time and took a short bus ride from it to another station an
                            hour away, from there I took the train to the summit near Machu Picchu. I’d seen some tall
                            mountains before, especially when traveling across the US from east coast to west; but the
                            mountains here were mindbogglingly tall. I usually don’t take vertical pictures but I pretty
                            much had to in order to encapsulate the sheer scale of these mountains. Once arriving at the
                            summit town I went to the bus stop that transports people from the town to the Machu Picchu
                            entrance and took the winding roads all the way up to the top.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I arrived on time and went on my route given for the day I arrived. I saw the usual sights
                            and luckily a few German guys that were there helped take a picture of me in front of one of
                            the iconic spots. I saw the huge mountains, old sights, tourists stopping in the middle road
                            to take selfies; the usual. I took a few panoramic shots to test out if I could do it or
                            not; luckily it worked and have some high quality surround pictures. Shortly after finishing
                            the route I took the bus back to the summit town, ate some local food and waited around 5
                            hours until my train ride back to Cusco arrived. I bought a few souvenirs, watched Star Wars
                            on my phone, and finally got on the train. It took a few hours to get back to the transfer
                            station and when I got there had to wade through hoards of people to get to the bus station.
                            Once I got there I got on, took a seat, and sighed a breath of relief since I wasn’t sure if
                            I was going to get on in time because the previous train ride was half an hour delayed. The
                            bus ride back was nice since it was already night out and I had a window seat. I saw all the
                            stars in the sky like I never had in a long time. By 9PM I arrived back at Cusco and went to
                            bed.

                            The next day I had free and decided to order some take-out to bring back to my hotel. I took
                            a good half hour walk to pick it up and came back. I regretfully forgot to ask for utensils
                            and had to resort to eating noddles with my hands (I don’t recommend this). But once I was
                            done I washed my hands, watched some videos throughout the day and prepared to fly back the
                            next day. I then flew back to LA, to Phoenix and the short ride home. I still had the travel
                            bug in me and immediately started plans to visit Mexico and the pyramids there.

                        <h3 id="t1-2">Mexico Trip (August 2023)</h3>

                        <p>
                            In August during another extended weekend I took a short direct flight from Phoenix to
                            Mexico City. I heard of a lot of bad things about crime there so I booked a capsule hotel in
                            the Airport and locked my stuff in a locker. I wasn’t paranoid since I remember reading that
                            of all the places to be in Mexico, Mexico City was the safest; but I at least wanted to have
                            my wits about me. Nevertheless I got my metro card when I arrived and reviewed my route to
                            the pyramids before I went to bed. The next morning I took the train to the bus station that
                            ferries people to the pyramids and then took the bus on an hour or so ride to them.

                            When I arrived I could see the pyramids right from the street, the scale of them was
                            massive. I knew I wasn’t able to capture them in one photo, so I took tons of panoramics and
                            stitched the image together. I walked around the sights reading the signs/history and taking
                            in the fact that I was standing on the same site as thousands of Aztecs before me. It was a
                            little disappointing that I couldn’t walk up the pyramids because they now banned it, but
                            understand for preservation purposes why they did that. I took a couple hours to walk around
                            and funnily enough overheard a Japanese tour going on; so I listened for a bit until I went
                            my own way.

                        <p>
                            The sky was pretty clear and I felt lucky because the night before I was reading that rain
                            was coming. I got my photos then left before the rain would ruin it. I bought some small
                            souvenirs since I packed a small bag on my trip and couldn’t bring back much; then took the
                            bus ride back to the airport. I ate some dinner at the airport then spent the night in the
                            capsule hotel, listening to the rain come in and soothe me to sleep. The next morning I took
                            the flight back to the US and planned my Europe trip. However some unexpected changes
                            happened shortly after.
