                        <h2 id="t2">Life Changing Event</h2>
                        <p>
                            Shortly after I arrived back in the US from Mexico I continued my work schedule as normal
                            for a bit. This was until everyone in the Arizona department at my company received and
                            email asking to meet in-person at an event. I thought this was a bit strange since usually
                            most big meetings have virtual seats available; but I thought “whatever” and continued as
                            normal. When that day arrived I was having trouble with one of my tires deflating and was
                            only 5 minutes late to the start of the 2 hour long meeting. “No big deal” I thought,
                            usually meetings have 5-10 minutes before they actually start to accommodate for late
                            arrivals anyways. Well, when I arrived I saw people getting up from there seats and thought
                            “oh must be a quick break from an intro speech”. Well… I saw one of my co-workers come
                            towards me and say “yeah, it sucks doesn’t it?”. Confused I ask what had happened, telling
                            her I literally just got there as people were getting up and she said, “everyone is being
                            fired”.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It took me back for a second since I thought she was making some joke or something and when
                            more people came over confirming it, it settled in. I knew ever since I moved out to Arizona
                            I had no intention in staying in the company longer than my 3-year repayment period on my
                            relocation; but it felt weird that in 2 months I’d no longer be employed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In a way it felt kind of freeing since I had intention of leaving by the end of next year
                            for Japan anyways, but still shocking. Weirdly too when I was in Mexico I was thinking of
                            ways of quitting without putting unnecessary workloads onto my co-workers. Thinking of ways
                            of asking managers and others on my team about how to divide work, manage my leave, and all
                            that; but GM pretty much did all that work in one day for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I mostly felt bad for people who had long careers or upcoming careers in the company who had
                            to support others. Understandably many of them were upset, mad, lost, depressed, etc; pretty
                            much every emotion you could feel after losing your job. At first I maybe thought it was
                            only the “low level” people like me and my co-workers getting laid off, but apparently
                            managers, senior mangers; pretty much everyone up to the top of the AZ department had no
                            indication that this was coming. I talked with a few co-workers about the whole ordeal and
                            shortly after just drove back home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I called my family telling them about the news and I started to plan what next to do with my
                            career and life.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="t2-1">Applying for Jobs and Moving</h3>

                        <p>
                            After a few days of “work” I started planning on what to do going forward and decided to
                            start applying for jobs in Japan while also working out a plan to move all my stuff from
                            Arizona back to Rhode Island. The reason I wanted to send stuff back to RI was because if I
                            move abroad I can’t bring all my stuff over like furniture, big electronics, etc; and
                            instead of letting it all go to waste I’d send it back home. So I started packing my
                            apartment up and setting up things for moving.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During this time I was having intense pain when swallowing foods and planned to see a
                            Gastrologist. I continued with my packing and at one point it became so unbearable that I
                            went to urgent care to get medicine. At first I thought I had an ulcer but didn’t want to
                            self diagnose before getting an Endoscopy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I pretty much called everyday home to figure out how to sort everything, what to pack, if
                            someone was going to fly out and help me, etc. At first I wanted to sell my car, ship
                            anything important back to RI, sell/donate/throw away everything else, and fly back home.
                            However we decided to have my dad fly out to AZ, help pack, take a trip to the Gastrologist
                            to get some results, and pack my car up with important things to drive back home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After a few short days everything was pretty much packed up. My dad and I used a trolley to
                            get rid of my cheap furniture and big items; and packed my car full with stuff. I wanted to
                            bring my purple mattress and got a vacuum seal bag; but unfortunately the seal broke during
                            packing and we had to give it away instead. The last day before leaving I got my endoscopy
                            done and luckily they found nothing wrong or abnormal about my stomach. So once I recovered
                            from my surgery the next day we drove out. Weeks later after I settled back in to RI the
                            pain went away and still don’t know the exact cause; my guess was on stress.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When driving back to RI it was pretty much the same route I took with my mom and step-dad
                            when I moved out to AZ from RI. This time I had some pictures on the way, now that I had a
                            fancy camera. It took us about 2 and a half days, and what felt like 6 hours of sleep to get
                            across the country. Once we arrived in RI I took a short nap to get some energy back and
                            started to unpack my things. Unfortunately that week it was high temperature and humidity so
                            that process was not fun. I also missed my purple mattress in that time too and shortly
                            ordered one to come.
