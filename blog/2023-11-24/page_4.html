                        <p>
                            After finally settling back at home and cleaning up my old room I started to get my daily
                            route back in order. I used my work laptop to check emails everyday and join required
                            meetings but knew that basically no work was being assigned anymore to people in AZ. So I
                            mostly kept applying for jobs online and work on Taurus for fun. It was around this time the
                            Unity Engine changes were popping up and I decided to drop work on Taurus in Unity in favor
                            of Unreal and started a Udemy course there. I kept up with my Japanese but kept it to
                            “reviews only” since I still felt stress in the whole process of moving and I didn’t want to
                            overwhelm myself with tons of new words.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At some point when getting something to drink from the refrigerator I saw some family photos
                            from downstairs sitting on the couch. I asked if it was any photos I scanned before from the
                            last few times I visited and found out they weren’t. Little did I know this was a start to a
                            new adventure I’d embark for a month or two. By this time it was early September and I
                            started to research how to scan 35mm film and figure out a way to add them to the family
                            google drive. Well, I got a dedicated machine for scanning and started my work; I got
                            binders and sheets to store them properly and took time time meticulously scanning each
                            film. I think it took 3 weeks alone of mostly scanning throughout the day to get everything
                            done.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By this point I got the interest to just “get it all done” and ask for literally every
                            photo, video, and tape we know of in the family to archive. I ended up getting an 8mm
                            reel-to-reel machine to scan those tapes, a capture card to record old VHS tapes and etc.
                            Towards the end of finishing those up I asked my uncle if he had anything left. My
                            grandmother asked him and from what she said, his response was “he’ll regret asking”. A few
                            days later I woke up and saw an 18 gallon tote, a big paper box, and stack of photos near
                            the door.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At this point I knew I needed to revise my archiving solution. For the longest time I
                            thought I already scanned the majority of the family photos and put them on google drive.
                            Mainly the container they were from, so photos in “Blue Binder #1” where put in a folder of
                            the same name online. However now that there were over 2000 photos, finding anything you
                            actually wanted was a nightmare. So during my process of scanning I decided that I’ll plan
                            on writing a PHP/MySQL site to manage it for me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The idea is that “all I have to do” is make a landing page where people log into a website
                            and search up the image they want. Instead of navigating through folders of random images on
                            Google Drive. That brings us to where I am now; still scanning photos but nearing the end of
                            the process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ll admit I have gone completely overkill on the family archive since 99% of people wanting
                            to look at the photos will just take a glance at the photos and move on. However from doing
                            lots of research on file formats, encoding methods, archival methods, etc; I’ve learned how
                            to do it the “proper way”. My reasoning being that, if I’m going to do this once I’ll do it
                            the right way instead of fixing things down the line later and regretting doing it
                            improperly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I mean by the “improper” way is how I had been archiving photos in the past. Which was
                            scanning photos on a flatbed scanner, cropping them, editing them, etc then saving them to
                            JPG at 60% quality. What this means is that if I find out later that the photo is reversed
                            or something is incorrect I have to find the original document in-person and rescan it. The
                            reason I can’t edit the JPG and flip the image is that every time you save a JPG it
                            re-compresses the file; so multiple saves down the line it means it’ll get worse and worse.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I’ve started doing now is storing two copies. An <b>lossless</b> original scan at the highest
                            quality I can store at and a <b>compressed / lossy</b> one that will be viewable online. What this
                            allows is that the “lower” quality web versions can be looked at and “criticized”. If an
                            error is spotted I can pull up the original scan and export a new compressed version. I have
                            yet to do this with the original documents I scanned years ago, but I plan to do those
                            months later since I don’t want to drive myself insane… (well more insane).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The original reason why I only stored JPEG versions in the past was to make sure I wasn’t
                            using too much space on Google Drive. But now that I plan on hosting the site, storage isn’t
                            an issue anymore. I could keep rambling on about the photos but I’ll try to end this post
                            with my future career and life prospects.
