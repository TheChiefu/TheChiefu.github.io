                        <p>
                            So this concludes my long exhaustive post about my half western and half eastern self. I love the life I’ve lived in America, the culture I grew up here in the US, and the people I meet along the way. But due to the large influence Japan has had on me, I wouldn’t feel satisfied with my life if I didn’t go out of my bubble and life my live abroad. Japanese culture has given me so much to love in appreciate in life and I want to experience even if for a short time a place which has given me much joy in life.

                            Will it be perfect? I guarantee not, there is struggle and strife everywhere in the world. However Japan is hardly the worst country to live in despite it’s problems. Plus it being such a close alley to America it’s actually a better country to visit/live than a lot of other nations. I want to see the world outside the lens of America and see it as a worldly citizen and I’m up for the challenges life will bring me in my journey there. Even if it requires learning the Japanese language, customs, and adopting a different life style. Life isn’t life without adventure.
