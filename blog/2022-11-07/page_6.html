                        <p>
                            It can’t be denied anime has had a big influence on many people around the world and yes
                            some people idealize Japan though anime, but for me I never used it in such a way. Similar
                            to video games I always saw it as a way to immerse myself in another world and experience
                            whatever emotion(s) the author wanted to provoke.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The earliest anime I watched was Dragon Ball Z and as a kid seeing super humans go around
                            fighting bad guys and going to all sorts of places was always a fun watch. I got really into
                            Dragon Ball Z, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, Bo-bo-bo, and various shows that used to play on Cartoon
                            Network in the 2000s. I played the games on my consoles, played fan games on the internet,
                            and really connected with the worlds and story telling. At the time I didn’t know where any
                            of this was from, it was just fun tv shows and cartoons to me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As time went on and I learned where they came from, how they were made, and seeing Japanese
                            original versions of the shows (usually the US releases were censored compared to the
                            Japanese versions), and so got more into learning more about them. I found out that the
                            “Saiyans” from Dragon Ball were called “Saiyan Jin” in Japanese, later finding out that
                            “Jin” meant “person or people” so literally “the saiyan people or race”. I was fascinated in
                            how the language worked and how it was different than English. I tried to learn by myself at
                            10 to learning the basics of Japanese but knowing typical 10 year olds I found it hard and
                            gave up. But it didn’t stop my fascination about learning about anime.

                        <p>
                            In middle school I started watching more shows and was probably the time I watched the most
                            in my life. I went through the backlog of older shows I didn’t watch as a kid, new shows I
                            found online, and some by accident through YouTube videos. I watched action shows, adventure
                            shows, romance, anything you could name (except horror, I still don’t like horror). One
                            common setting however in Japan that seemed to come up the most was Japanese school and
                            cities. Obviously since most of the audience that watches anime in Japan are teens to early
                            adults these are familiar sights to them. But to me I was interested in how different and
                            similar Japan was like.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As I transition to high school I continued watching anime, less so than before but got into
                            more emotionally deep and comedic shows/movies. Some notable examples being the Ghibli
                            movies like before, <a

                                Evangelion</a>, and
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop" target="_blank">Cowboy Bebop</a>. These
                            shows weren’t like the ones I watched as a kid (other than Dragon Ball Z) since
                            it wasn’t just fun action and comedy. They put characters in situations that made them
                            emotionally vulnerable and shows either how they deal with their emotions
                            positively/successfully or not.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Evangelion being famous for this because it’s director in the original creation of the TV
                            show in the 1990s was in a serious episode of depression during it’s creation. Manifesting
                            itself in the main character’s situation and attitude. The character show feelings of
                            despair, hopelessness, and indifference. This show to me is important since it help me
                            understand some emotions I had felt in the past and that other people go through similar
                            emotions in life. I understood feelings of depression weren’t unique to me, but seeing that
                            show showed me how it manifests in others and how despite being made in a country across the
                            globe from me how everyone in life struggles.

                            After high school and into college I more or less fell off with anime TV shows as a whole,
                            not because I stopped liking them but felt it too time consuming. So I started watching more
                            anime movies and these continued the interest in emotionally heavy media. Newer movies that
                            I watched at that time were:

                            found more inspiring and deep movies to which I still hold to my heart even now.

                        <p>
                            The last movie having the biggest impact on me, since I felt so invested in the character
                            and her struggles. It helped me understand the struggles of not only single parents but
                            adoptee parents and children. Although not in such extreme examples of the movie, the same
                            emotions of taking care of a child, watching it grow, and going through struggles to provide
                            for the child. As someone who has single parents, this movie hit especially hard. I never
                            cried so much to media ever since Clannad After Story and Interstellar.

                            And that is the end of where anime impacts my life, the next section being video games and
                            concluding with general Japanese culture.
