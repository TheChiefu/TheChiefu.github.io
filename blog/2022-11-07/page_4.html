                        <p>
                            Growing up I was around my parents and grandparents listening to classic rock, watching
                            movies from all eras, playing games, etc; the usual childhood for someone in America.
                            However Japanese culture seemed to seep it way into almost every aspect of my life,
                            unknowingly through localized versions of Japanese games via Sony and Nintendo consoles,
                            Anime through Cartoon Network; as well as though Japanese games shows online and on TV. It’s
                            not uncommon to know people who grew up in the 2000s and has had a slight interest in
                            Japanese culture though these means.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early in life I was really into Japanese game shows and would find as many clips and shows
                            as I could. My favorites being “Hole in the Wall” (originally known as <a

                            Where the former is where a giant foam wall with a cutout is pushed
                            towards a contestant that needs to somehow take the pose of the cutout and not get pushed
                            into a vat of water, while the latter is a show where contestants try to stay silent and not
                            laugh while various wacky activities go on around them.

                            There are a plethora of other game-shows I watched hours of when I was younger. But over
                            time as I searched the internet for various things such as game and TV show soundtracks more
                            and more Japanese media seemed to make its way to my attention. I started to discover music
                            from Japan and being amazed by the different styles and mood they could evoke.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The earliest music I got into being fan created songs from a famous game called <a

                            Unbeknownst to
                            be me at the time, this game series spawned countless circles or サークル
                            (groups of people who create fan content related to a piece of media; ie. game, show, etc)
                            who create endless amounts of remakes and covers. The earliest ones I remember being these
                            ones:

                            The Touhou community was really the gateway to me exploring more into Japanese internet
                            culture and therefore music and media. Over time expanding to anime soundtracks, games
                            soundtracks, and etc from numerous games. I even got into Jazz, a genre I didn’t really care
                            about at first through the wonderful mix of western cowboy culture and future Japanese space
                            operas in the form of the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop"

                        <p>
                            Around 2014 to 2017 was really the era in which I discovered an interest in almost every
                            genre of music, since Anime and Japanese games seemed to be so creative in their usage of
                            other culture’s music. If I didn’t tell anyone that these songs: <a
                                href="https://youtu.be/rzXEw5VTtoo" target="_blank">Étoile Et Toi</a>, <a

                            <a href="https://youtu.be/rQiHzcdUPAU" target="_blank">Komm Süsser Tod</a> were from anime
                            or even Japan no
                            one would of guessed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Funnily enough learning more about Japanese culture has introduced me to other more cultures
                            around the world. Which makes sense since Japan after the <a
                                href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/dwe/86550.htm" target="_blank">opening of

                            their culture has shifted from being isolationist to more “inclusionist”. More specifically
                            they still retain their cultural roots but take and morph aspects other cultures into their
                            own to grow theirs. So you get these weird combination of cultures mixed into one product,
                            and it creates wonderful pieces of art.

                            When I got into watching Studio Ghilbi movies I was into the time periods and people that
                            those movies portrayed. Even though fictitious most of the movies from that studio are based
                            on 1920s-1980s depictions of western and Japanese life. The movie <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porco_Rosso" target="_blank">Porco Rosso</a> takes
                            place

                                target="_blank">From Up On Poppy Hill</a>
                            takes place in 1963 Japan during it’s
                            time of economic recovery, <a

                            Although not the point of these movies, I like seeing depictions of life before my own time
                            to see what people were like and acted like; and for some reason Animation helps transport
                            me to those time periods. I feel like the scenery and human nature portrayed in animation
                            connects with me more, since seeing actors makes it feel more “modern”, while an artistic
                            interpretation feels more close grandiose and meaningful. And since we don’t have real or
                            color photos from times like the 9th century and so on, seeing depictions of those times is
                            more awe inspiring. This is just my introduction to Japanese media through the web, Japanese
                            music has also played a huge part in my life.
