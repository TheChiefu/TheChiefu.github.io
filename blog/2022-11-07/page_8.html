                        <p>
                            Although music, movies, and games all fall under the umbrella of “Japanese Culture”, what I
                            mean by this section is more of overarching themes such as history, modern life, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be honest until college I didn’t really know much about Japanese history other than World
                            War II, even though I was into Japanese media. I’ll be honest I probably had a skewed idea
                            of Japan when I was in high school wanting to move to Japan in the first place, but I always
                            knew it had it’s problems. However learning about the <a

                            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-occupation_Japan" target="_blank">post-war
                                economy</a> helped inform me of how the culture of Japan came to be.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I never really knew why Japan was apart of the Axis in WWII until I learned that pressure
                            from the European nations of the time made Japan feel like they needed to prove themselves
                            to the empires of the time. Fighting the Russians in the Russo-Japanese war, the capture of
                            Manchuria, capture of the Korean Pennisula; Chinese Mainland; and many Pacific Islands all
                            in the name to prove their status as an Empire. This helped me understand the “why” in which
                            Japan conducted itself at the time. It’s called the “Dark Era” of Japan for a good reason
                            since it’s host to many of the worst crimes committed by a nation period, rivaling the
                            horrors of the Holocaust of the Axis Powers, Gulags of the USSR, and slaughters of natives
                            by Europeans/Americans in the 16th and 17th century.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At first I was confused as to why modern Japan would have statues of people such as
                            Commodore Perry who threatened Japan with violence if they didn’t open their country in the
                            1800s or figures such as General MacArthur who (to them at the time) was related to the
                            nuclear bombing of two cities, fire bombings on their major cities, and made a mockery of
                            the Emperor by standing next to him towering in height.

                        <p>
                            Then I realized, the society wants to move on from their dark period. They don’t want to
                            forget, but want to forgive. Although the Japanese government could have (and still needs to
                            improve) in it’s response to apologize for it’s numerous war crimes (I’m looking at you
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre" target="_blank">Incident at
                                Nanjing</a><b><i></i></b>), the people at large want to leave the past in the past. I’m
                            still of the mind that Japanese education needs to be similar in German education in which
                            they ensure their people know of the crimes of the past, but I’m not their government. As
                            well as countries like the US talking about what we did to natives and Japanese nationals in
                            interment camps, but that’s besides the point.

                        <p>
                            But if you were to talk to any Japanese person no sane one would ever endorse the Japan of
                            the past. So as I learned more about their history the more I am interested I got about
                            their society as a whole and how this past shaped them today. Modern Japan is usually touted
                            as this advanced society online and usually anything related to Japan is some wacky new
                            technology or media. Although true in some senses especially relating to places like Tokyo
                            or Osaka, the rest of Japan is not the same. It’d be like calling all of America super
                            advanced because of places like Silicon Valley or the Dallas-Forthworth Area, yes those
                            parts of society are home to technologically advanced companies but it doesn’t mean places
                            like North Dakota are anything like them.

                            One thing Japan has the US beat in however is public transportation, and this is where my
                            interests are piqued. Anyone who knows me knows I loathe driving, and the 2 years I spent at
                            University walking everywhere made me realize that I prefer walking as much as I can over
                            driving. Living in the Phoenix area where car driving is essential made me really abhor cars
                            much more. So to me, seeing the network of train cars, walkable cities, and general
                            pedestrian convenience makes me a little jealous in Japanese infrastructure.

                        <p>
                            This is were my interest in visiting and eventually moving to a city or town crop up from.
                            To me my type of job or career doesn’t involve much exercise and even doing mundane things
                            like walking to work and back, walking to the store, or even biking seem like a nice
                            lifestyle changes compared to my current one in a city infested with 6 lane highways next to
                            my apartment. This may be the “grass is always greener” attitude talking since it is the one
                            part of my post I have zero experience in, however this is one of the appeals modern Japan
                            has on me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I do still want to live in a more sub-urban area eventually so I will lose a bit of that
                            convince that cities provide, but I still believe that overall it’s an improvement than I
                            could live in a place such as the United States. That being said I’m more apt to
                            discrimination being a foreigner, so only time will tell if the benefits are more than the
                            deficits. However overall I believe modern Japan and it’s influences it’s had on me drive me
                            towards the country, and the half of me that’s American feels content with my American side,
                            but my Japanese side feels half fulfilled without living in Japan even if for a short period
                            of time.
