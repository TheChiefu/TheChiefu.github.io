                        <p>
                            When I say I’d like to think of myself as half American half Japanese I don’t
                            <i>literally</i> think I’m Japanese by any stretch of the imagination. It’s more like 80%
                            American and 20% Japanese, but what I mean is that I like to attribute half of my
                            personality to take parts of each culture and combine it into one. I know I’m an American
                            who was raised in America by American parents, surrounded by American culture, etc but I
                            never felt truly 100% American. That’s not to say I hate American culture or am obsessed
                            with Japanese culture or anything. What I mean is that overall don’t feel very “American”
                            and more worldly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The phrase “you can do anything” is common in America and while a positive statement is not
                            really realistic. I don’t want to discourage people and always try to get the best out of
                            people. However I’m opposed to blatantly lying to people just to make them feel better since
                            I feel it’s disingenuous and hurts the person in the long term.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another common “Americanism” is patriotism and while I don’t oppose patriotism in theory, in
                            practice many people take it overboard. I’m all for wanting your country to succeed and make
                            change for the betterment of it’s people, but to some people even questioning or insinuating
                            change is “insulting” or “disrespectful” to America.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To me things like: pressuring children into standing for the national anthem, having the
                            American flag everywhere (when in most countries their flags are posted near government
                            buildings only), and obsession towards the military feel unnecessary at best and
                            nationalistic at worst. I believe worshiping an idealized image of a country is never a good
                            thing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is were I feel like I different 100% from most Americans. I’d almost guarantee even
                            saying what I just said is enough to get a response from some Americans telling me to get
                            out or leave the country. I mean no disrespect to Americans for loving their country, I’m
                            just personally not a very patriotic person and choose smaller interpersonal/community
                            interests over a national interest. If something drastic were to ever happen in the US and
                            how it operates I’m not the guy to try an go out and change the entire country. I’m much
                            more susceptible to moving to a country that fit my beliefs since one person can’t change an
                            entire culture but one can go to one that fits theirs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Don’t get me wrong I don’t hate America or it’s culture, I find the history of the country
                            to be fascinating, love learning about small local communities around the country, and find
                            the leap in technology the US made from the early 19th century to the 21st incredible. It’s
                            just that I never felt myself as “American”, not as an exclusionary “I don’t fit in” but as
                            I don’t feel connected to the country is any personal way. I feel like anywhere could be my
                            home and growing up I loved where I lived, knew great people, and have a great family from
                            my home state.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However I always had the feeling that the state or even country I grew up in wasn’t were I
                            wanted to live my entire life. There is this entire world (and hopefully when I’m older
                            solar system) to see and I want to be apart of it. As someone into ancient history and the
                            origin humanity, I’ve always loved learning about other cultures and the way they lived
                            their lives. I learned how their cultures shaped the way they looked at the world and the
                            more I dove in the less I felt connected with how Americans typically self describe
                            themselves as.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What I’m trying to get at here is that this is the <b>one major</b> thing that always made me feel
                            like I never was an “American” or fit in culturally. I’m not patriotic, I’m not
                            individualist, and not seeking the “American Dream” so to speak. This isn’t a bad thing but
                            heavily explains my interest in Eastern or more specifically Japanese culture and it’s focus
                            on collectivism. I’m not saying one is better than the other (individualism vs collectivism
                            both have their issues) I just lean more collectivist than individualist.

                        <h2 id="t3">Me and Japanese Culture:</h2>

                        <p>
                            This is where the diversion to my personality and Japanese culture tie together. Since I
                            have that lack of feeling like I belong culturally as an American, I drifted towards
                            Japanese culture to fulfill that role. Japan used to be more of a nationalist anti-foreign
                            culture historically but post WWII they did a (mostly) full reversal, and the one that
                            exists today is more open to morphing outside cultures into their own.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s not to say modern Japan doesn’t have it’s problems: it’s overwork culture,
                            “<a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+nail+that+sticks+out+gets+hammered+down">the
                                nail that sticks out gets hammered down</a>” mind-set, and glacial pace of change in
                            government and
                            culture are just a few of the problems Japan has today. However compared to the issues I
                            described as me feeling un-American, Japanese culture meshes much more with my personality
                            and beliefs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The collectivist nature of society being the most related to me, since most of how I act is
                            in relation to “how much can I avoid inconveniencing people”. I’ll put myself in situations
                            where I’ll put a burden on myself in order to make something easier on someone else because
                            I couldn’t bear the thought of making someone else’s day worse or harder.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If someone looks like their in a rush at the store I’ll let them cut so they can go quicker,
                            take time out my free time to help a friend out with something they need even if I’m doing
                            something, etc. Most of this is just common courtesy people do in all countries but I take
                            it sometimes to a different level. Japanese culture due to it’s collectivism shares many
                            traits with what I just described and that to me is what I feel most connected to. The
                            culture of respecting others even if it may inconvenience you, the good of the whole versus
                            the part.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now after reading this some might think that I think Japanese culture is better than
                            American culture but that’s not the case. If could give 101 reasons of things in Japan that
                            I dislike, find concerning, and/or hate. I’m just comparing the two in relation to my life
                            and find that culturally Japan matches my core personality than American culture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s not to say I don’t like American culture, I love a lot of things that were produced
                            from America namely it’s interactive media and technology. Computers as we know them today
                            wouldn’t exist without America, the same with space exploration technology due to NASA, and
                            so on. America like any country has done a lot of good for the world it’s just not perfect.
                            And that’s were I take the half American and half Japanese mindset from. I like culture
                            products America has provided and some that Japan has and mix it into my own personality.
                            The reserved “Japanese” side mixed with adventurous “American” side.
