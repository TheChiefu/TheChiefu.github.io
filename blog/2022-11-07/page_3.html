                        <p>
                            Naturally I’m more of a reserved person who likes to indulge in media that makes me pause,
                            think, and reflect on myself or the world. As a kid when I was bored waiting in the car, at
                            school, or wherever; I’d like to people-watch, analyze how people interacted with each
                            other, or just see how the trees or clouds would make a funny looking shadow. To me I like
                            those calm and tranquil moments where I can just sit there relax and feel happy just
                            “being”. I’ve noticed that Japanese media uses this mood perfectly. In a lot of anime,
                            movies, or shows there are times where nothing much in the scene happens and it’s just the
                            sound of trees swaying, someone taking a breath, or some other insignificant sound but the
                            impact it has is huge.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It helps me take in any previous information that I just consumed and let’s me digest it
                            without “overfeeding” my brain with information. A video on YouTube describes how an
                            animation studio called “Studio Ghibli” purposely does this, and hence why a lot of my
                            favorite movies come from them. Even Japanese games make use of this period of
                            “nothingness”, here is <a href="https://youtu.be/m0zQXJhyRL8" target="_blank">a scene</a> from one of my
                            favorite games “NieR Replicant where no music
                            plays for the first period where the character discusses a serious topic. It helps focus on
                            our emotions toward the scene without music pushing us in a particular direction. Of course
                            not all Japanese media is this way, most anime and games are similar to their western
                            counterparts as being action packed or drama filled. But I feel like they excel at creating
                            media with a particular focus on the human experience. Western or American culture plays
                            into the action side of things that I like and excel at that area.

                        <p>
                            Gears of War, Halo, Call of Duty, and many more are staples of American video game series
                            focused on action packed game-play. They nail down the right amount of time to quickly react
                            to something (making reacting fast rewarding), cooperative play to encourage either
                            team-play or fun competition, etc. Other games like the Elder Scrolls, No Man’s Sky, and
                            Mass Effect perfectly capture exploration and my sense of journey. That’s not to say western
                            media doesn’t display any of the qualities Japanese ones do, it’s just in lesser quantity
                            and in different forms of media.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Video games are usually where Western cultures shine in that regard. Especially musical
                            composers who produce emotional works such as: <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7isqWSWGM2s" target="_blank">Marty O’ Donnell</a> from Halo, <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wMiMDBHnJ0" target="_blank">John Williams</a>
                            from Star Wars, <a href="https://youtu.be/FSVHx23ByhM" target="_blank">etc</a>. So combining the sense of
                            action/adventure from Western/American media
                            and thought provoking emotional media from Japan melds into my personality forming who I am.
                            I tend to lean towards the calmer Japanese side but I always know where to turn to if I’m
                            ever feeling exploratory or an excited mood.

                            So that’s where my idea of a “half/half” from the east and west comes from, a blend of the
                            world’s two main cultural “divides” (for the lack of a better term). All starting from a
                            small introduction of western media as a kid and Japanese media through the internet.
