                        <p>
                            So before I start this post I’d like to preface this with an explanation. I was going to
                            originally going to post about my upcoming trip to Japan but got heavily side-tracked in
                            explaining my love for Japanese media and lost the point of it. So I decided to make a
                            dedicated post that an upcoming one will refer back to so I don’t overwhelm readers with
                            information. So with that out of the way I’ll transition right into it!

                        <h2 id="t1">Introduction</h2>

                        <p>
                            After writing numerous posts on this site about myself I’ve come to realize how diverse my
                            interests and life actually is. I don’t mean this as a boast but a realization since
                            whenever I had to write in school about myself or introduce myself to new people I usually
                            just say the same things, “I like computers, games, and nature”. Which although true is
                            really non-descriptive about my personality and who I am as a person.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason I’d introduce myself or talk about myself in that way was because I never knew
                            how to talk about myself. I never really organized my thoughts in a way to clearly talk
                            about who I am and delve into what makes me “tick” so to speak. So this is what this post is
                            trying to dig up from my thoughts and create a cohesive image of well… me. I won’t go into
                            every detail on trying to self-realize, but since I’m relate this post into my trip to Japan
                            this will talk about how I got into Japanese media/culture, why I like an maintain an
                            interest in it, and how it’s shaped me and my life.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A good way to describe my personality as a whole would be “Half American” and “Half
                            Japanese”.
