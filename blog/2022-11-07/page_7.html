                        <p>
                            In a similar vein to music, video game have had a big impact on my life. More so the western
                            counter parts since companies such as Bungie and Epic games released <a
                                href="https://youtu.be/hhPzZCighjI" target="_blank">video documentaries</a> describing
                            the process of game develpoment, as well as other companies such as Bethesda releasing tools
                            to modify their games aiding in learning about games. However it can’t be understand how
                            much the Legend of Zelda had on me and my personality.

                        <p>
                            Anyone in my family can tell you I was obsessed with that game series especially Ocarina of
                            Time. I love fantasy, I love adventuring, and I love action games. Zelda is the perfect
                            combination of world exploration, action gameplay, and fantasy elements. I used to act out
                            parts of the game in Kindergarten at school during recess, draw in free time at school about
                            the game, and pretend to make my own versions of the game. Zelda being the catalyst to start
                            my interest in learning about video games. However since this is a post about the Japanese
                            side of my interests and personality I’ll relate this back to that side of myself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I remember sometime in late middle school I found a Japanese copy of Ocarina of Time and
                            being so wowed by the Japanese text and thought it was the coolest thing I’d experienced in
                            a game. While not impressive on it’s own it did help me find more Japanese versions of games
                            I liked and start an interest in the Japanese side of the video game world. Around end of
                            high school to start of College I found a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier:_Automata" target="_blank">NieR Automata</a>, and that game shell
                            shocked me that no game ever did.

                        <p>
                            As my description of Maquia I made before, I love media revolving around heavy emotional
                            content. NieR I fell is like if I took my outlook in life and made it into a game. What I
                            mean is that generally speaking I believe that life inherently doesn’t have a meaning and
                            that people give their live meaning through their interests. NieR’s main message is this but
                            with clever writing, relatable characters, and a perfect musical score to accompany it.

                                alt="Game cover for the NeiR Replicant remake."
                                onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='nier-replicant.jpg'" />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I went into NieR completely blind, all I knew about it was the music I found on YouTube and
                            images people kept posting online about the main character 2B. So when I started playing I
                            never felt more connected with a game than the moment I started. I loved how it used
                            psychology as it’s main element in story telling, since it tells a story about the human
                            experience and how people struggle in life trying to find their purpose. After finishing the
                            game I never felt more happy yet sad a the same time that it ended; however it fit the
                            message of the game in dealing with your emotions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Suffice to say I was ecstatic when I heard the company that made NieR Automata was remaking
                            the original 2010 game NieR (or NeiR Replicant / Gestalt depending on your region), of which
                            I never played. So when it came out right around the time I was graduating college I played
                            it day 1 (while also streaming it to a friend who I got hooked on NieR Automata). I knew I
                            was going to like it but to me it narrowly beat out NeiR Automata in storytelling and felt
                            another wall of emotions flooding me as I played that game. The music, characters, and again
                            environment all mesh to make a beautifully flawed world, that makes question myself and my
                            existence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I wish I could play those games again for the first time and know that no game I have ever
                            played since those two have ever compared. However the impact the NieR games have had on me
                            is huge and I thank the creator for creating what to me are pieces of art. I feel like more
                            games and media as a whole should focus more on the emotions the NieR games focus on, mainly
                            existentialism since it makes you stop and think about your life.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If it weren’t for the influence of other Japanese media throughout my life I would of never
                            gotten to experience these games and media and I don’t know who I’d be without them. Which
                            brings me to the last point, the influence and interest in general Japanese culture.
