                        <p>
                            Ever since I started playing video games as far back as I remember, I always knew I wanted
                            to make one myself. To me growing up playing all the consoles I could find was like
                            experiencing whole new worlds outside of the boring world. Video games allowed you to
                            experience things that you couldn’t in real life: going to space, exploring ancient ruins,
                            and other grandiose activities. As someone who loved to learn about history, science, and
                            basically everything I could, I had a deep sense of wanting to explore. However as someone
                            who’s family couldn’t go (or didn’t want to) travel and see other places video games became
                            my source of exploration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assassin’s Creed let me explore the idea of what being in a historical setting may be like
                            and how people lived their lives (although not the most accurate); Mass Effect and Halo let
                            me explore space settings that I could of only dream of doing in real life (I was obsessed
                            with space, and binged all of the SpaceRip YouTube channel and Science Channel as a kid);
                            and Legend of Zelda became my identity for the better part of 10 years due to it’s fun
                            dungeons design and fantasy settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As any of my family can tell you I was obsessed with video games as a child. At school
                            during free time I’d draw out game ideas like 3-6 way battles between forces in Star Wars
                            such as the CIS, Republic, Empire, and Rebels similar to the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Battlefront" target="_blank">Star Wars
                                Battlefront</a> game. I’d
                            redraw scenes from the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, draw video games console ideas
                            including their UI/menus, etc.

                        <p>
                            At one point I got interested in designing my own console and “brand”, to which I very
                            ingeniously called the “Gbox” or “Gaming Box” (basically a straight rip on the Xbox’s name).
                            I made drawings of the console including the ports it’d have on it, the main menu,
                            controller, and so on. I even made a freewebs account to make a website that talked about
                            the console. Eventually I made a new “brand” called “Infinite Entity Gaming” and made a
                            Yolasite for that one (I was obsessed with making websites at one point).

                        <p>
                            In the back of my head while drawing these ideas I always had my idea of making my own Zelda
                            game. For some reason my elementary school kid brain thought it was a cool idea to have a
                            game where you collect triforce pieces from Zelda but instead of the normal 3 pieces of
                            Courage, Wisdom, and Power you collect 9 of them. What could the other 6 be? Well they were
                            weren’t named (as far as I can remember) but they were a different color to the normal
                            yellow triforce. There was 3 from the orange triforce and 3 more from another one to which I
                            believe was blue (I could be wrong, I don’t have any pictures of my ideas that far back). I
                            decided to call the game, “The Legend of Zelda: The Silver Triforce” a game that surely
                            Nintendo wouldn’t have a problem with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then went and wrote down a bunch of ideas for game ideas (for the Zelda game and not):

                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A game where you can fly up from the Ocarina of Time game world on a gryphon to a sky
                                city of the gods</li>

                                the guitar and 6 pluck-able strings where the strum bar was to simulate a more realistic
                                guitar.</li>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Funny enough looking back on the list a lot of my old game ideas became real things. The
                            first idea became The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword in 2011, the second became the Rock
                            Band Pro Guitar, and the third idea became a real item in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
                            Princess in 2006. I guess the developers of those games also had those ideas but couldn’t
                            execute them at the time.

                            Over time I became more interested in the game development process after watching ViDocs
                            from Bungie, developer documentaries from Epic Games on the Gears 2 Bonus Disc, watching
                            videos on YouTube of people dissecting games (historically and technically), and so on. I
                            started to feel a deep passion for understanding games outside of a player’s perspective. I
                            did more than just make random sketches in my notebook but planned out stories, dungeon
                            designs, and the like. Here are a few old scans of my ideas from my Zelda game (to which I
                            renamed to “A Hero’s Legacy”).

                        <p>
                            Around 2010 or so I got more “serious” with making a game after spending a lot of time
                            creating
                            ideas and planning stories. So eventually I just winged a google search for “free game
                            engine”
                            which as one would imagine would come up with a lot of terrible software. However at one
                            point I
                            did come across Unity in 2013 and ever since then it became my engine of choice. Before I
                            get to
                            the point of talking about specifics like Reclamation and Taurus I’ll talk about my
                            adventure of
                            being a solo developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I learned actual processes in developing a game I started to branch out in what I was
                            willing
                            to learn about. I tried to make music for my games and at first used really simple MIDI
                            renditions of Zelda songs in Mixcraft 4 to make my own “versions”, but eventually created my
                            own
                            simple songs using that. I recorded foley sound such as walking in the snow, grunting
                            underwater, and other silly stuff to get a good sound library to work off. I took pictures
                            using
                            my mother’s camera of the ground and rocks to get textures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I even had a folder on my grandfather’s computer that was a compilation of random sound
                            files
                            from Ocarina of Time, my foley sounds, music, and a bunch of other random files. Here are a
                            couple songs of that I made in that time period:

                            I wish I still had my old foley sounds I recorded on my iPod Touch and rock band microphone
                            at the time since it’d be really cool to use audio of me as a 10 year old in game, but it’s
                            been lost to time. I remember walking home from school and getting snow crunching, used my
                            closest to get less “echo-y” sound, and other fun stuff like using the windows sound
                            recorder. My cousins and I would make home videos back then so I got used to using the
                            computer for creative work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A lot of it was by no means great but it was pretty fun to make and now listen to now again
                            later to remind myself how I far I’ve come since then. You can even check of my old
                            Newground profile where I posted my music! After doing lots of scattered “game development
                            work” I tried piecing a game idea together and eventually settled on working on my Zelda
                            game but getting rid of any ties to the actual series due to obvious copyright
                            infringements. I called it “A Hero’s Legend”.

                            This is were I got <b>serious</b> and put focused effort into a single game rather than
                            scattered
                            concepts. I drew dungeons on grid paper to make designing easier and designed weapon.
                            Unfortunately I never found the original drawings but I did find designs is MS paint of when
                            I was making an MMO (I was big into World of Warcraft at the time).

                            As one does for their first game idea it was super grandiose and large in scale, obviously
                            too big for a single person let alone a 12-15 year old. But I continued onwards despite
                            having no coding knowledge and no experience with Unity outside of the terrain editor. At
                            one point my friend in middle school who is more artsy than me drew up a cool monster design
                            and I decided to make a digital version of it as reference.

                            The game world was supposed to span 5 continents, 4 in each cardinal direction and one
                            “end-game” continent in the middle. Obviously over time I reduced the scope of the game down
                            the more experience I got in learning about game development, and eventually settled on this
                            overall map.

                            Still very big for my first game idea but more condensed to what I had planned in the
                            beginning. Add the fact that I changed it to single player rather than an MMO/Multiplayer
                            and it made it more “reasonable”. I added to the story by writing the introduction sequence
                            and some possible route, then I then got to work on designing dungeons and came up with a
                            Molten Dungeon and Underwater Dungeon in 2015.

                            It was exciting transforming a drawing to an actual 3D model, then a walk-able environment.
                            At first I wasn’t sure if I should of made the dungeon one big model or in parts, and for
                            some reason ended up making it all one massive texture and model… oops. It wasn’t ideal if
                            you wanted to make changes but at the time I was just excited to making something other than
                            a drawing. I kept up with doing these designs until summer ended and had to focus back on
                            school. I didn’t work on a game again until I worked on Taurus as a Skills USA project with
                            a friend and stared to learn how to actually code in C# (albeit simply), then work on
                            Reclamation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once I graduated high school I felt like I had all the time in the world to put my new
                            founds skills onto working on Taurus and spent my 2017 summer throwing all my ideas at the
                            project. Unfortunately at the time I felt like I needed to work on it as a resume builder,
                            so during breaks in college I spent worrying about the state of the game. Restarting,
                            redoing, all the things beside planning. This is where my exciting positive story ends with
                            game development and where reality starts to kick in.

                        <h2 id="t1-4">The Reality of Game Development</h2>

                        <p>
                            The more I learned about game development and what goes into it them the more uninspired I
                            got on working on any hobby projects. I knew internally that a sole developer cannot develop
                            the next Halo or Zelda but because of my picky choices in games, my expectation for what
                            “good” game is, is above my skill-set. I’ll read my old game scripts, viewing my old
                            drawings, etc and be inspired by them but know that unless I put in hours of dedication into
                            things like <b><i>learning</i></b> how to 3D model and make music I’ll never achieve my
                            goals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I know the only viable path forward to achieve my goals by practice, making smaller scale
                            games, and more reasonable goals. But whenever I brainstorm any ideas into Taurus or “A
                            Hero’s Legend” I can’t think of anything I’d want to make that’s not above my ability. Sure
                            I could make a 2D game of Taurus and make it on rails, since I’d made a project like that
                            before when learning Unity; but I personally don’t play games like that and developing a
                            game you don’t find fun feels unrewarding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I’ve left my dreams of making Taurus and other big projects behind since I know they’d be
                            a fruitless effort. I’ll still add to the story and lore, as well as location planning but
                            mainly as a hobby just because I like world building. I don’t think I’ll ever create fully
                            fledged game versions of them unless I pay an artist lots to make them become a reality. So
                            unless I’m willing to pay or learn those will stay dreams for the time being. This leaves me
                            to my next dream and current time sink, <b>Japanese</b>.
