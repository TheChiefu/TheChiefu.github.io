                        <p>
                            This leaves me to where I am today, confused and scared about my future and goals. I wish I
                            could end this post on a more happy note but I’m not going to lie about my self. I wrote in
                            my last post that I was battling with depression and lying to myself wouldn’t help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I haven’t completely given up hope on my dreams to make a game, learn Japanese, and move
                            abroad but waiting for years and years, wasting my life away for dreams hurts a lot. The
                            dreams that I’ve described in this post have been life long dreams that I’ve had for as long
                            as I can remember, and in 10+ years I’ve achieved zero of them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I remember the last time I talked to my mother about my dreams, she said that “You’ve been
                            waiting your whole life to do them” and realizing how true it was. As a young kid I just
                            enjoyed the things I like and thought nothing of them. But as I got older I felt like
                            because I <i>wanted</i> to make a game I <i>needed</i> to make one; because I <i>wanted</i>
                            to move to Japan and
                            learn Japanese that I <i>had</i> to do it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I was graduating high school I pushed back studying abroad in Japan because it was
                            expensive (2017), then in college pushed back studying abroad again due to covid (2020),
                            then when I graduated college pushed back moving to Japan 3 years since I felt inadequate
                            with my Japanese (2022). I even had the thought the other day that I might need to wait
                            until 2025-2026 to move to Japan with how slow my Japanese is progressing. What’s stopping
                            me from wasting more of my life in limbo for a dream I may never achieve?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I may be in a period of growth and I’ll finally achieve one or many of my goals in the
                            future, but I earnestly feel that I have to let go of one of my dreams to not let depression
                            worsen due to sense of failure. I can’t spend my life worrying about my goals otherwise I’ll
                            have this mental fog my entire life, and that’s not a life I want to go though.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So for a while or until I move to Japan I’ve been thinking of letting my game dreams die
                            off. Those things made me happy in the past and excited, but now all it does is bring me
                            sadness so it’s best to leave it in the past. At least I can make measurable progress in
                            Japanese with enough brute force and will.
                        </p>
