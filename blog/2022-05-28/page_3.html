                        <p>
                            I wish I could remember the moment in which I wanted to learn Japanese but I feel like it
                            was a natural inclination over time due to my interest in learning and exploration. There
                            wasn’t a single thing like with video games and Zelda that got me hooked, but I think it was
                            exposure to the country and media that drew me in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the longest time I watched clips of crazy Japanese game shows on YouTube, a show called
                            “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Survived_a_Japanese_Game_Show">I Survived a
                                Japanese Game Show</a>“, and watched Toonami on Cartoon network. At the time I didn’t
                            really understand that these things were from a different culture, it was just fun
                            entertainment to me. But as I got older I came to realize that a bunch of stuff I liked
                            already came from Japan.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Dragon Ball Z and other Cartoon Network shows in the 2000s? Those were anime from the
                                80s and 90s dubbed and exported to countries like the US. </li>
                            <li>Nintendo games? All localized and imported games from Japan</li>
                            <li>The game shows like: “Hole in the Wall” and such were obviously just TV rips from Japan
                            </li>
                            <li>And so on…</li>

                            I eventually just decided when I was around 13 that I want to move abroad to Japan and live
                            there, since I thought it was a cool idea.

                        <h2 id="t2-2">The Beginnings of Learning</h2>

                        <p>
                            Once I learned about this country that I knew nothing about, I got interested in learning
                            the language. I tried when I was like 12 or 13 to learn ひらがな (Hiragana) or the 46 syllabary
                            symbols on a random website by just writing them down based on what I thought they looked
                            like but as one would imagine this didn’t really stick and I ended up giving up on trying to
                            learn it for a while.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Despite giving up, I was still interested in Japanese stuff online like subbed anime, touhou
                            fan videos, and other Japanese online media. I never really got into learning the language
                            seriously until the summer of 2015 where I sat down, loaded up Memrise, and bashed the
                            characters and words into my head. This is the first time I’d actually put the time and
                            effort into learning the language in a serious manner.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I wanted to continue learning the language during school but obviously a school on the east
                            coast isn’t going to have a Japanese class. So I looked up online AP/college courses on my
                            school’s website in order to take it though my school. I found one class that was college
                            level but I had to pay for it, so I begged and pleaded to my mother to sign me up for the
                            class. Over time of showing her my progress in the language she gave in and during one
                            semester of my high school I attempted my first actual course in Japanese.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It went… horribly; the reasoning being was my stubbornness. The reasoning it went bad was
                            because one, I had learned at my own pace during summer and two, I didn’t want to give up my
                            free time after school. Since the course was taken online it was outside of normal school
                            hours and had to be taken on my personal computer. Eventually my stubbornness got me to quit
                            the class and I felt ashamed of wasting my mother’s money on a class <b>I begged for</b>. I
                            still
                            kept learning bits and pieces in summer but it slowly halted once I got into making Taurus
                            at the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next time I saw Japanese was in 2019 when I started my classes at the University of
                            Rhode Island as a 3rd year student. The reason I started to late instead of a first year was
                            because I originally started my higher education at my state’s local community college which
                            didn’t offer Japanese. Luckily when I started classes in fall of 2019 I still retained a lot
                            of what I studied years prior.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first week was Hiragana and second Katakana (the second set of 46 characters) and it was
                            super easy. When I studied in the summer I actually studied vocab from the first 3 chapters
                            of the textbook “Genki”, and that’s the book we used in class. I didn’t study the grammar or
                            Kanji (Chinese characters) but overall had a nice experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Obviously it got harder but I was able to keep up because I was just so happy to finally be
                            learning the language in a structured manner. I was being taught to read actual Japanese and
                            not just random words from an online deck. This was when I was at <b>the first hump</b> in
                            the
                            Dunning-Kruger graph:
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I felt like I could take on any Japanese you through at me, even though I knew internally
                            that I couldn’t. It was a fun time honestly, especially after the cruel 2 years I had to
                            endure in French class during high school that I had to take. Over time though as the graph
                            states, the more I learned the less and less confidence I got in the language. Although I
                            knew I was learning more the stupider I felt like I was getting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the winter of 2020 when I was agonizingly submitting work applications for jobs after
                            college, I was trying to get my Japanese learning priorities set straight due to this lack
                            of confidence. I used to use Anki (a flash card program) in the summer time to cram vocab
                            and Kanji into my head for class but always ditched it after was done. I felt like I was
                            starting to stagnate and got into the habit of using the program everyday to retain my
                            knowledge in the language. I’ve been doing it everyday even to this day (May 28, 2022) since
                            November 17th, 2020 or October 28th 2020 if you don’t count the one day I missed (oops).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However this feeling of doubt never went away as I was approaching what that Japanese
                            community online like to refer as “the intermediate plateau”. Where it feels like no matter
                            how much you learn, you feel like you didn’t learn anything. Even though I used to attend
                            all the after-school Japanese events that I could, I always felt like I never “understood”
                            Japanese.

                        <h2 id="t2-3">Graduation and Self Doubting</h2>

                        <p>
                            When I finally graduated in May of 2021 I felt like I couldn’t get far into Japanese without
                            being able to read as many as words as I possibly could. So I sat down and drilled out my
                            vocabulary from my decks, starting learning as much Kanji as I could on <a
                                href="../2022-02-07/page.html">Wanikani</a>, and did
                            that for months. Eventually I got burnt out because I was doing thousands of cards a day and
                            reached out to the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/">Learning Japanese</a>”
                            subreddit for help. I found out that what I’d been
                            doing was supposed to be supplementary to a primary source of learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This made sense to me but then really made me think about how I was learning Japanese. I
                            stopped using textbooks since without a teacher I’m bad at self learning and so resorted to
                            tools for learning. I naively thought that cramming words would make me understand the
                            language; newsflash it doesn’t. It wasn’t until March 31st 2022 until I made a
                            <a
                                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/ttghjj/stagnation_and_a_stubborn_learner_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">reddit

                            asking for help that I realized I need a better way to study.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The problem being is that all the advice I saw (even applying to other languages) was to
                            study <b>on top of</b> consuming Japanese media. This wasn’t an issue right? I said before I
                            like
                            Japanese media especially from childhood with games and anime. Well what I didn’t mention
                            was that from before learning Japanese to now, was that learning the language destroyed my
                            interest in all Japanese media.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I don’t know what to call it, being stubborn or lazy but <i>because</i> I had to put a ton
                            of
                            effort into even understanding the simplest sentences I started to resent Japanese media. I
                            avoided trying to see or read it outside of a learning environment and still do. I’ve
                            trained myself to essentially hate seeing the language and it has destroyed and interest in
                            viewing Japanese media to consume.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I still love learning about the history of the country, social issues, and etc via
                            <b>English</b>
                            content. But as soon as I see a video in Japanese or a post in Japanese my instinct is to
                            just avoid it. This wouldn’t be an issue if I was learning Japanese as a hobby since I could
                            just take a break or drop it, however I wanted to move there. I still had my childhood dream
                            of moving abroad but hated learning the language.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="t2-4">Where I Am Today</h2>

                        <p>
                            This is where it puts me today, doubting my goals and dreams since I’ve felt like I lost a
                            part of what made me who I was because of laziness and stubbornness. I put hundreds of hours
                            into learning about the history of the Tokugawa and Samurai rulers, the modern issues of
                            social pressures at work, the horrors of Imperial Japanese pre-WW2, and the list goes on.
                            All in the name of knowing about the country I wanted to move so that I don’t get a
                            glamorized and falsified sense of it.

                            However, because Japanese feels like this wall of impossibility or hamster wheel of learning
                            in front of me I think of giving up everyday. The only thing keeping me back studying
                            everyday cramming words, kanji, and vocabulary into my head is so that I can still achieve
                            my dreams. Maybe I haven’t lost my interest in Japanese media and it’s just shifted without
                            me realizing what new things I like, but it still doesn’t hurt any less that I lost
                            interest.

                            I often think about what I’d do if I quit learning Japanese and didn’t move to Japan and the
                            only plan I’d have is to move to Washington state and work for a game company there. While
                            although not a bad idea, isn’t really what I want to do with my life. Studying Japanese and
                            moving to Japan feels as apart of my identity as video games do and the thought of giving up
                            makes me depressed, so I just endure it everyday.

                            Some days I love learning the language and it comes easy, but most days I feel a sense of
                            failure and an overwhelming thought of being stupid. I know I’m probably just stuck in the
                            “intermediate plateau” and it’ll get easier once I’ve memorized thousands upon thousands of
                            words, spent hours reading the grammar online, and memorized the rest of the Kanji I haven’t
                            finished on Wanikani; but until that day happens I’ve just learned to sit with the
                            suffering.
