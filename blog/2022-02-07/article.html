                        <p>
                            To preface this review I must stress that it is written from a visual learner’s perspective
                            and <b><i>will</i></b> have bias in that regard due to the nature of how I learn. If you
                            aren’t too
                            visually inclined this information may still be valuable but make sure to remember this bias
                            when reading. With that out of the way, let’s get started!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kanji, it’s every Japanese learner’s biggest fear when first coming across the language. If
                            you’re a stubborn/slow learner like me it can seem like this impossible feat to be able to
                            read anything other than 平仮名（ひらがな）and 片仮名「カタカナ」since it’s already 46 characters to learn for
                            each syllabary. However Wanikani takes the approach of using a “Spaced Repetition System” or
                            better known as “SRS”
                            <sup><a href="https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Think_SpacedRepetition_LA.pdf"
                                    target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
                            <sup><a href="https://dres.illinois.edu/education/study-skills-and-learning-strategies-resources/spaced-interval-repetition-technique/"

                            on top of “Mnemonics” to make learning Kanji more digestible.
                            Before going into Wanikani itself let’s understand exactly the underlying systems at play
                            what make it (at least for me) a very powerful tool.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Section 2-->
                        <h2 id="t2">The Psychology Behind Wanikani</h2>
                        <p>
                            To start of, let’s talk about <b>SRS</b>. It’s the idea of using reviewing concepts within
                            certain
                            time frames to cement them in your brain’s long term memory. So you start by learning a
                            concept for the first time, so you learn it as best as you can, then recall it a short time
                            later. Once you feel confident in your ability to remember that concept, you wait a certain
                            interval of time (let’s say an hour), then review it again. If you recall it without issue
                            you exponentially increase the time of review until you become proficient at recalling a
                            concept.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So for example if we want to learn the phrase for “Banana Bread” in French we look up or
                            find the phrase: “le pain de banane”<sub><a
                                    href="https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the/french-word-for-banana_bread.html">[3]</a></sub>.
                            We then learn it to the best we can, then we recall
                            it in 10 minutes. If we recall the phrase we successfully have remembered it in our short
                            term memory. Now we recall it in an hour, if successful move it to 1 day, then 3 days, ad
                            nauseam (or until a year passed, then you’re <i>probably</i> good). This concept can apply
                            to
                            anything it doesn’t have to language learning, but Wanikani and other language apps use this
                            system for recall to help learners pick up a language. Now that we’ve covered SRS let’s talk
                            about “Mnemonics”!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In essence “Mnemonics” is a visual learning way to remember concepts. However unlike just
                            visual learning it adds another layer to the visual stimuli. It uses stories and other
                            lingual concepts to append to the concept you’re learning. So for example when I had to
                            learn the 46 Hiragana, I imagined them as pictograms that look like certain objects. So when
                            I first learned 「し」 I imagined someone holding a “<b>SHI</b>eld” (emphasis on the “shi” part
                            since
                            it creates the same sound as the symbol) to remember that that symbol/concept. Again with
                            「つ」being a “<b>Tsu</b>nami” wave, 「え」being an ice skater, 「ぬ」being “<b>Noo</b>dles”, and so
                            on. It doesn’t
                            exclusively have to be similar sounding to English like I did with 「し、つ、ぬ」, as long as there
                            is a conceptual relation between two ideas that make the new concept stick better. Now
                            enough for the psychology lessons on learning concepts, now to the actual tool at hand!
                        </p>

                        <!-- Section 3-->
                        <h2 id="t3">What <i>is</i> Wanikani</h2>
                        <p>
                            Wanikani is a site that uses both the concepts of <b>SRS</b> and <b>Mnemonics</b> as it’s
                            foundations,
                            making the content structured based on the assumption that the system <i>they’ve</i> created
                            will
                            know the best time for you to review. They’ve laid the content in Levels with <i>easier</i>
                            content
                            at level 1 and the hardest content at level 60. Meaning if you’re starting from zero getting
                            into Wanikani can be great since it’s a structured path laid out for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have some experience in Japanese it may be tricky if you want to learn specific Kanji
                            at your own pace because you <b>have</b> to learn the earlier concepts first before being
                            able to
                            move on to the content you want to use. However either way if you’re interested in using the
                            service there is an underlying assumption that you <i>already</i> know both <b>Hiragana</b>
                            and <b>Katakana</b>.
                            This is because in order to learn Kanji and it’s related concepts, you need to know <i>at
                                least</i>
                            Hiragana to be able to read the <b>Kanji</b> and <b>Vocabulary</b>. This is crucial since
                            there are 3 main
                            categories of terms that Wanikani presents to you: <b>Radicals</b>, <b>Kanji</b>, and
                            <b>Vocabulary</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Radicals</b> are technically a real “things” that Kanji are made up of (科 – “Course”
                            being made
                            up of both: 禾 [grain] and 斗 [ladle] ) but Wanikani often has their own meanings and radicals
                            so I am most critical of this aspect of the website. The concept makes sense because more
                            complicated Kanji like (警, 薬, 識) are made of other <b>radicals</b>, however I
                            <i>personally</i> believe
                            that if you’re learning Kanji in the first place you’re learning the easier Kanji first then
                            using that knowledge to build up and learn the composite Kanji not learning radicals and
                            Kanji as independent concepts. To my destain when using the website Kanji you <b>already
                                learned</b>
                            appear as radicals and I just see it as pointless padding. However enough babbling
                            about radicals let’s get to what we’re really here for <b>Kanji</b>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Kanji</b> are the big scary Chinese symbols that make up the bulk of Japanese text. In
                            Wanikani
                            you start out with the basics like: (一、二、三、四、etc) and build you’re way up to fun ones like:
                            (鬱、翻、鰐). Don’t worry about how scary the last 3 are, if you know the basics learning complex
                            Kanji can actually be pretty straight forward since they are composed of other Kanji.
                            Wanikani has you learn either the 訓読み (Kun’yomi or Japanese Reading) or the 音読み (On’yomi or
                            Chinese reading) to start off and once you get them right enough times you are then given
                            <b>Vocabulary</b> terms using the Kanji you have proven to memorize.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Vocabulary</b> is the most straight forwards since it’s applicable in all languages.
                            Wanikani is
                            pretty much just like a normal flash card tool when it comes to Vocabulary since it’s just
                            memorizing words like you would any language. The reason they put them after the
                            <b>Radical</b> and
                            <b>Kanji</b> is that once you’ve memorized the level’s previous concepts you can use that
                            knowledge
                            to learn words quicker. Since there’s been times when I’m learning a new word and before I
                            click on the “next” button to see the reading I can most likely guess it because I know the
                            vocabulary word’s <b>Kanji</b> readings. But that should cover the over-arching topics that
                            make up
                            Wanikani, let’s now talk about the elephant in the room; the pricing.

                            When first using Wanikani you should be loaded in to your “Dashboard” where you’ll see
                            available <b>“Lessons”</b>, <b>“Reviews”</b>, <b>“Review Forecast”</b>, and a plethora of
                            menus. Whenever you
                            have anything new to learn the “Lessons” section should be a pink color with the number of
                            new concepts to learn. Similarly the “Reviews” section will show any reviews you have
                            available accompanied with a blue background and image.

                            amount of “Kanji passed” before I can “level up” to learn vocabulary words and eventually a
                            new level. Below that meter is the level’s items such as: <b>Radicals</b> and <b>Kanji</b>.

                            track how much progress you’ve made on individual item’s progress. Finally to the right is
                            the “Review Forecast” where you can check at what times new reviews will appear.

                            Below all of the level specific information you can see your overall account progress /
                            statistics. The five boxes that are labeled at the top of the image above show how many
                            items are at an “item’s individual level” or officially the “SRS Stage”. Meaning that if an
                            item is considered an “Apprentice Level” item it will show up in reviews often until it is
                            pushed to a “guru level”, then “master level”, so on a so forth if you keep getting it
                            right. If you at any point get an item wrong it pushes it down a level and will have to
                            re-learn it from that level again. To see a more detailed break down of the

                            Finally bellow the SRS Stages is the general information column sections. The leftmost
                            showing you the newest unlocks you’ve made in the last 30 days, the center showing you
                            “Critical Condition Items” or items you’ve been consistently been getting wrong (also
                            providing a “correct” percentage rate), and the rightmost showing items you’ve most recently
                            “burned” or “memorized”. That should cover the Dashboard now to cover <b>Reviews</b> and
                            <b>Lessons</b>.

                            Lessons are as their title implies, a session in which you can learn new concepts with
                            provided information. They are split into different sections depending on <i>what</i> you
                            are
                            learning. The sections are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Radicals</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Name (Containing: Mnemonic)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>Vocabulary</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kanji Composition (How word is composed of Kanji)</li>
                                <li>Meaning (Containing: Mnemonic)</li>
                                <li>Reading (Hiragana reading of word)</li>
                                <li>Context (Example sentences)</li>

                        <p>
                            The <b>Meaning</b> section is where Wanikani provides one of it’s primary selling points,
                            <b>mnemonics</b>.

                            Usually within the “Explanation” section is a story that the creators of the website have
                            created to help you memorize concepts. What this is trying to accomplish is create imagery
                            in which your brain uses to latch on to a hard concept to make remembering it easier. Since
                            if a story is absurd the more likely you are to memorize it. However over time as you recall
                            the concept and get it right the story is supposed to drop from memory as the concept’s
                            meaning stays, utilizing the psychology of SRS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section is incredibly helpful especially in the early stages since Kanji/Radicals are
                            pictographs and connecting concepts to them help their meanings stick easier; so
                            <b>pay attention</b> to these if you are having trouble with them. If you are having no
                            trouble understanding them and are getting them correct without needing mnemonics then feel
                            free to skip theses sections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you’re done with a <b>Lesson</b> you’ll move onto the <b>Review</b> section.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here you’ll be provided with a screen in which you’ll be asked for an item’s English meaning
                            (Radical, Kanji, Vocabulary), a Kanji’s On’yomi or Kun’yomi reading, or a Vocabulary term’s
                            reading. If you get the item correct your text box will glow up with green, if you get it
                            wrong it will turn red and you can review an item’s details by pressing the “Item Info”
                            button in the bottom row.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here details of an item are explained to you, in this example above it’ll show the
                            <i>reading</i>
                            since that’s the item being quizzed. If I were answering the <i>vocabulary</i> meaning it
                            would
                            show <i>that</i> instead. However you can view all of an item’s details by clicking on the
                            “Show
                            All Information” button at the bottom. Once you are done you’ll be presented with the
                            “Summary” screen showing you what items you’ve just reviewed.
                        </p>

                            The only difference between Lessons and Reviews is the fact that reviews just review terms
                            you’ve already learned and use the same user interface as the second half of lessons. That
                            and since you can’t fail Lessons items since they’re brand new the review’s lesson summary
                            shows that progress of individual items like this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="wkreviewsummary.jxl" class="blogElement"
                                onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='wkreviewsummary.jpg'"

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This pretty much covers this section and 90% of what Wanikani offers, so I’ll try to tie
                            some useful tidbits of information before concluding this review.

                            click on the respective tab drop-downs on the top of your dashboard page. Such as “Levels”,
                            “Radicals”, “Kanji”, “Vocabulary” or using the search bar. Each drop-down menu provides a
                            list of items per 10 levels and per section a breakdown of the items as individual items.
                            This is useful if you want to look into each item on a more specific basis.

                        <h2 id="t7">Conclusion</h2>

                        <p>
                            Wanikani can be an incredibly powerful tool if you stick to it and study everyday. I know
                            when I started in Japanese 101 in my University it helped get me jump started on being able
                            to read since instead of rote-memorization like I learned in school I found that the stories
                            made the Kanji stick for me. I was initially scared of taking the plunge into Kanji since
                            it’s overwhelming when you first look at it but Wanikani breaks it down into manageable
                            levels that mask the amount of Kanji there is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I personally lucked out on that aspect of using the tool at the right time since I was
                            learning Kanji from scratch at school and on Wanikani so I personally don’t know the
                            experience of jumping in after having previous knowledge on Kanji. However I will say that
                            even if you’ve studied using Kanji in compound words without knowing the exact meaning
                            behind them I will stress that (at least for me) knowing <i>what</i> those characters mean
                            helps me
                            learn new words faster and understand old words better because I have a better understanding
                            of what it <i>means</i>. Instead of memorizing a big concept like 地理的特徴 as “Geographical
                            Features”
                            I can break it down into:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>「地理」（ちり）Geography or (Ground 地 + Reason 理)</li>
                            <li>「的」（てき）Like (form adjective from nouns)</li>
                            <li>「特徴」（とくちょう）Features/Trait or (Special 特 + Indication/Sign 徴)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking each Kanji meaning into consideration and understanding <i>how</i> that word is
                            composed.
                            Obviously when reading I’m not breaking it down that much but to get the fundamental
                            understanding down I do, then as I come across it more often, the better it sticks. It’d be
                            absurd if I remembered it as “Ground reason-ish special indication”, but it sure helps build
                            up the image in my head.

                            So having a website that teaches mean what all these symbols mean, how to read them, how to
                            apply them to words, etc to me is worth the value the service asks for. I intend to learn
                            Japanese for a long time and I intend to master it to the best of my ability so for someone
                            like me buying a lifetime is worth it’s weight in gold. However if you’re just getting into
                            learning Kanji take the chance for the first 3 levels if you think this approach is a good
                            fit. If you don’t like it you don’t lose anything and if you do you have a website with a
                            plethora of information and a helpful community.

                            I just have to warn you however if you do start to keep up on on the reviews daily since
                            it’s <b><i>slooooooow</i></b> in the beginning. So keep reviewing to get some items into
                            rotation so that
                            whenever you check the website you have something to do rather than no review or lessons
                            when you’re itching to learn.
