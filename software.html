                        how they work or how they were developed.

                                Happy Ball was an interesting project, not because it was super challenging or too
                                easy but because it deviated from what I generally did in projects. When I first
                                learned how to use Unity when I was around 11 years old I wanted to make something
                                simple to get into learning how to program. So I decided to make a 3D ball rolling
                                game, but limit the axis to the X and Y coordinates so I can make levels easier. But
                                eventually after learning the basics I wanted to make a different game using the new
                                skills and ended up dropping hall ball.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Years later and over the Winter Break of 2020 I wanted to challenge myself to make
                                Happy Ball from scratch after years of learning new programming skills not just in
                                C#, but also C++ and etc. Over the years of learning I found out how to save file
                                data, load from paths, modify game-objects in real time depending on the situation,
                                and etc. So I went full throttle into making Happy Ball. I started from the basics
                                of making a 2D side-scrolling level and made “prefab” objects that I could use in
                                any new level I wanted to create. I setup everything modular so levels could
                                automatically textured based on settings, and give win requirements all from one
                                manager. I didn’t have to hard code anything in and on top of that, the player could
                                customize their look!

                    <h2>Console Grid Game</h2>

                                This was a really interesting school project not because it was easy, but because of the
                                limitations and how I had to overcome them. The project specified a 5×5 maze in which
                                the player navigates it to find the treasure hidden within. Hidden within are obstacles
                                in the way to stop the player. The instructor left everything else up to the students.
                                Only to adhere to the main requirements and be creative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what I decided to do was challenge myself and create a visual display on the console
                                and draw the grid based on the given Width and Height of it. As well as drawing the
                                player’s position correctly in that grid. The core of the program only took about a week
                                but the last week was just adjusting a 1D string array to draw onto a 2D screen from top
                                left being (0,0) instead of the mathematically traditional (0,0) being center screen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I wanted to make the program cross-platform with any platform but couldn’t find a
                                suitable solution in time by the deadline to implement screen clearing. I could draw the
                                grid every update, but then it would make the console screen scroll line by line. I
                                wanted to imitate a game instead instead of a console program so I used the Windows
                                screen clearing command. Other than that I was extremely satisfied in getting a drawing
                                solution to exist, and work for any given grid size.

                                Taurus is a game I work on in my free-time to really delve deep into creating video
                                games. I started working on this project with one of my school friends during my senior
                                year of high school as part of a game design competition. It started out as a Starfox
                                like game, putting the player on-rails having enemies spawn from the side of the screen.
                                I was tasked with creating 3D models and the playable game while my partner worked on
                                concept art and story ideas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As time progressed and the competition came, we made a playable tutorial level
                                explaining the details of the game. Once the summer months started in 2017 I worked on
                                the game on/off slowly improving the game until one day my hard-drive failed and had to
                                restart. Currently I work on it when I have the free time, but focus on work over the
                                game. So its a nice side hobby project.

                                Reclamation was a video game concept created in my senior year game design class. This
                                project was created within the course of a strict 3 month schedule and our teacher gave
                                us this deadline to give us a realistic perspective of the game development process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the team was tasked with creating concept art, story creation, and gameplay
                                ideas. I was tasked with taking the concepts and putting the necessary elements into an
                                interactive demo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As critical as I am with the demo in terms of graphical quality and technical issues, it
                                did help me get more comfortable in the Unity game engine. I was given limited ideas to
                                implement in the time period so I tried to make the best of the situation. It all went
                                well in the end and we presented the concept to our school’s staff and the local news,
                                which wrote an article about our presentation. Unfortunately most of the people who
                                worked on the project after graduation weren’t able to work on the project so it was
                                eventually scrapped.
                            </p>

                                I did however revisit the demo later on in April of 2022 and optimized it to the best of
                                my ability since it ran so poorly in the past due to inexperience. I called the new
                                version “Reclamation Redux” and wrote about the process in an <a
